abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are envisioned as a potential pathway to safer, more economical nuclear electricity generation and supply of industrial heat. MSRs under consideration today are either solid-fueled salt-cooled designs or liquid-salt-fueled designs with chloride or fluoride based salts. A significant knowledge gap exists in the data for the fundamental properties relevant to fuels and coolants for MSRs that needs to be addressed in order to expedite the technical readiness level of the MSR design concepts. With the rapid development and improvement of computational materials science, computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations are widely used as an effective and reliable tool to investigate the atomic interaction in materials. In this article, the density of the LiCl-KCl system was determined via AIMD calculations and verified using new experimental analyses. AIMD was further utilized to calculate the compressibility, heat capacity, enthalpy of mixing, and Gibbs free energy of mixing. This work spans a wider range of compositions and temperatures than have previously been explored computationally for this pseudo-binary system and provides the basis for further advanced thermophysical property evaluation utilizing AIMD methods.}

abstract = {Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to calculate select thermophysical and thermodynamic properties of NaCl, UCl3 and NaCl-UCl3 molten salts. Following established approaches, the AIMD simulations include a model for Van der Waals interactions. The Langreth & Lundqvist (vDW-DF2), DFT-D3, and density-dependent energy correction (DFT-dDsC) dispersion models are first tested for molten NaCl in order to assess their accuracy for density and heat capacity predictions across a range of temperatures. Based on the NaCl results, the vdW-DF2 and DFT-dDsC methods are extended to the UCl3 system and compared to available experimental data. Next, mixtures of NaCl-UCl3 are investigated and analyzed with respect to the deviation from ideal solution behavior. For the DFT-dDsC simulations, density deviates by up to 2% from an ideal mixture, with the maximum occurring close to the eutectic composition. The mixing energy also deviates from an ideal solution and exhibits a minimum of about -0.074 to eV per formula unit, again close to the eutectic composition. Finally, the compressibility and species diffusivity of the pure and mixed salt systems are calculated. The diffusivities are slightly reduced in the mixed compared to the pure systems and the compressibilities loosely follow a linear correlation as a function of the UCl3 composition. The trends observed for mixing properties are rationalized by correlating them to the coordination chemistry, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining the extended network formed by U and Cl ions as the NaCl concentration increases. The concentration at which breakdown of the extended network occurs, roughly coincides with the minimum of both the mixing energy and the deviation from ideal solution behavior for density.}

abstract = {Thermodynamic descriptions of higher-order molten salt systems are essential for the effective application of molten salt technologies. However, for pyroprocessing and molten salt reactor development, a complete description of the key Li-Na-K-U(III) chloride system has yet to be provided. To remedy this, we applied the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach to all available phase equilibria and related thermodynamic measurements that include new differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) observations for pseudo-binary and pseudo-ternary systems to obtain consistent and accurate sets of thermodynamic properties. An outcome of that effort was the apparent discovery of a previously unreported intermediate compound in the NaCl-UCl3 system. In this effort, we adopted a unique approach to the quantification of uncertainty in phase equilibria obtained from DSC measurements, which can provide distinct advantages in phase diagram analysis. The methodology indicates that reported values of uncertainty are often underestimated. The assessed systems of the current effort were incorporated in the publicly available Molten Salt Thermal Properties Database - Thermochemical.}

Gibbs energy modelling of the subsystems KCl–UCl3 and LiCl–UCl3 was carried out primarily using phase diagram data from the literature. For the Gibbs energy modelling of the KCl–LiCl subsystem, new phase boundary data corresponding to four terminal compositions (xLiCl=0.03, 0.05, 0.95 and 0.97) obtained through differential thermal analysis data along with thermochemical and phase diagram data from the literature were used. Thermal analysis was also carried out for KCl–LiCl eutectic mixture containing small amounts of UCl3 (xUCl3=9.03×10−3 and 1.79×10−2). The liquidus temperatures for these compositions were found to be 637K and 674K. Electromotive force data for dilute solutions of UCl3 in the KCl–LiCl eutectic melt, measured in the temperature range 708–833K in the present work, were found to be in good agreement with the literature data. These data were also used as input for the Gibbs energy modelling of the KCl–LiCl–UCl3 system. In order to improve the quality of the resulting Gibbs energy functions of the quasibinaries and the quasiternary, enthalpies of mixing of the corresponding melts estimated using an empirical correlation based on surrounded-ion model were also used as input. Finally, the generated Gibbs energy functions were used to compute phase equilibria.}

abstract = {The molar enthalpies of mixing (ΔmixHm) in the liquid potassium chloride-uranium(III) chloride mixtures have been measured with a Calvet-type high temperature microcalorimeter over the entire composition range at 1113 K. All the melts are characterized by negative enthalpies of mixing with a minimum value of about −17.5 kJ·mol−1. The minimum of the enthalpy of mixing is shifted towards the potassium chloride-rich compositions and located in the vicinity of xUCl3 ~ 0.40. The obtained results are discussed in terms of complexes formation in the liquid mixtures under investigation. Experimental mixing enthalpy data were used together with existing literature data in re-examination of KCl-UCl3 phase diagram. Analysis of the literature data on KCl-UCl3 phase diagram has indicated that all of them are not correct because the existence of K3UCl6 compound was ignored in spite of experimental facts pointing its existence. Reinterpretation of all existing data by CALPHAD method showed that the system under investigation is characterized by existence of K2UCl5 and K3UCl6 congruently melting compounds, and three eutectics (KCl-K3UCl6, K3UCl6-K2UCl5 and K2UCl5-UCl3, respectively). K3UCl6 solid compound exists at relatively narrow temperature range from about 800 K to congruent melting at about 892 K.}

abstract = {Passive molten salt reactors are receiving a significant amount of research attention for their inherent safety. While KCl-UCl3 exhibit high UCl3 loading of 53 mol% at the eutectic composition, their physical properties remain largely unexplored for both forced and natural circulation. Here, we employ classical molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the physicochemical properties of KCl-UCl3 molten salts at various temperatures and compositions. The computed density, heat capacity, and viscosity show that only viscosity exhibits temperature dependence while the others rarely change between 600 °C to 800 °C. The computed ionic structures reveal the formation of polymer-like uranium network structures at compositions above 40% UCl3, a distinct feature of KCl-UCl3 compared to NaCl-33%UCl3 eutectic mixture. We rationalize that the U network structure increases the absolute viscosity, yet also provides the temperature-dependent viscosity via allotropic U3+-Cl− polyhedral coordination. The molten salts are also assessed for both forced and natural convection with the computed physicochemical properties.}

abstract = {Properties of molten salts are of interest for a wide-range of applications, including nuclear waste partitioning, heat transfer fluids, and synthesis methods. While there has been extensive work showing the value of molecular modeling with interatomic potentials to predict molten salt properties there have been very limited studies of molten salts from a fully first-principles approach. In order to establish optimal approaches and their strengths and limitations in first-principles molten salt modeling, this work provides extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the LiCl–KCl molten salt system that are validated against existing literature. The basic thermokinetic properties of volume, thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and diffusivity, are calculated for LiCl, KCl and the eutectic LiCl–KCl liquids at multiple temperatures. Convergence testing reveals 216-atom unit cells and simulation times of 6–12ps are sufficient to provide results with acceptable uncertainties and agreement with experimental data. The results provide a framework of first principles molecular dynamics simulations in the LiCl–KCl molten salt system that can be extended in future research to predict less well-established properties, e.g., the behavior of solutes.}

abstract = {The development of next-generation molten salt reactors relies on accurate knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the candidate coolant and fueled molten salts. These thermophysical properties include density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity. Because of difficulties in measuring thermophysical properties of molten salts, there are many gaps in the current state of thermophysical property knowledge of these salts, particularly those that contain actinides or beryllium. Therefore, leveraging modeling techniques to estimate unknown molten salt thermophysical properties and guide future experimental measurements has high value for the nuclear industry. In this study, the densities of molten fluoride pseudo-ternary salt systems, which are of interest to the nuclear industry, were estimated using Redlich-Kister expansion and Muggianu interpolation techniques. The pseudo-ternary systems considered for estimation in this study were NaF-LiF-ZrF4, LiF-BeF2-ZrF4, LiF-BeF2-ThF4, NaF-LiF-BeF2, NaF-KF-BeF2, NaF-ZrF4-UF4, and NaF-BeF2-UF4. This Redlich-Kister estimation approach accounts for nonideal mixing behavior based on pseudo-binary subsystem interaction parameters determined from experimentally measured pseudo-binary system density data sets. The Redlich-Kister estimation was compared with the method of additive molar volumes, which assumes ideal mixing. The Redlich-Kister approach was also used to determine previously unknown binary and ternary interaction parameters based on experimentally measured density data sets for select pseudo-ternary salt systems. The results of this study show improvement in density estimation using the Redlich-Kister approach for all systems considered compared with estimation by additive molar volumes. Furthermore, this analysis allowed for the estimation of nonideal density behavior in experimentally unstudied ZrF4-UF4 and BeF2-UF4, as well as the quantification of ternary interaction in NaF-LiF-ZrF4, NaF-BeF2-UF4, and NaF-ZrF4-UF4.}

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the USA, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R&D focuses on three main lines of research. The USA focuses on the FHR, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The EU, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. MSR development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-IV designs with intrinsic safety features. Continuing joint efforts are needed to advance common molten salt reactor technologies.}

	abstract = {Molten chlorides are a good choice for fast-spectrum molten salt reactors, but many of their thermophysical and transport properties are not available. In this work we use classical molecular dynamics simulations based on the polarizable-ion model to investigate the structural and transport properties of NaCl-UCl3 at various U3+ mole fractions. Molar volume, coordination structure and number, network structure, heat capacity, diffusivity, and ion conductivity have been simulated. We find strong variation of the second coordination shells (U-U and Cl-Cl) with U3+ mole fraction. This is consistent with the increasing network formation or oligomerization of UCl63− and UCl74− units via shared Cl− ions. The movement of Cl− is strongly coupled with U3+ as the U-Cl network structures become dominant in the mixture when the mole fraction of UCl3 is >0.25. Evaluation of a heat-transfer figure-of-merit suggests that 0.20 to 0.30 is an optimal mole fraction of UCl3 to achieve both lower operating temperatures and better heat transfer.},

@article{Grimme,
	abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ``zero-damping'' formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations are applied to the study of LiCl-KCl eutectic and UCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic. The densities of the molten salt mixtures are optimized by FPMD simulations in NVT ensemble, and the local coordination structures are evaluated in terms of radial distribution functions and partial static structure factors. Both self-diffusion coefficients and ion conductivities are evaluated from the mean square displacements using Einstein relation for diffusion coefficients. It is conformed that the FPMD simulations give satisfactory structural and transport characteristics compared with experimental observations. Therefore, the predictability of FPMD simulations for structural and transport characteristics of molten salt mixtures is confirmed, and the FPMD simulations can be useful measurement in the establishment of database of actinide behavior in molten salt mixtures essential for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuels.},

@article{BENGTSON2014,
	abstract = {Properties of molten salts are of interest for a wide-range of applications, including nuclear waste partitioning, heat transfer fluids, and synthesis methods. While there has been extensive work showing the value of molecular modeling with interatomic potentials to predict molten salt properties there have been very limited studies of molten salts from a fully first-principles approach. In order to establish optimal approaches and their strengths and limitations in first-principles molten salt modeling, this work provides extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the LiCl--KCl molten salt system that are validated against existing literature. The basic thermokinetic properties of volume, thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and diffusivity, are calculated for LiCl, KCl and the eutectic LiCl--KCl liquids at multiple temperatures. Convergence testing reveals 216-atom unit cells and simulation times of 6--12ps are sufficient to provide results with acceptable uncertainties and agreement with experimental data. The results provide a framework of first principles molecular dynamics simulations in the LiCl--KCl molten salt system that can be extended in future research to predict less well-established properties, e.g., the behavior of solutes.},

	abstract = {Density-functional studies of structural and electronic properties of transition-metal sulfides formed by 3d transition metals, based on the local spin-density approximation and including non-local corrections to the exchange--correlation functional (generalized gradient approximation), have demonstrated the importance of magneto-volume effects and magneto-structural effects, but could not achieve full agreement with experiment. A further improvement is to consider electronic correlation effects due to tightly bound and localized d-states on the transition metal atoms. With the DFT + U method used in this work, these correlation effects are taken in account and yield improved predictions for volume, magnetic moment, exchange splitting and bandgap. For MnS the semiconducting gap is correctly predicted, and for MnS2 the high-spin AFM type-III state can be stabilized over the low-spin state. For FeS even weak correlation effects lead to better predictions for the semiconducting gap, volume and magnetic moment.},
