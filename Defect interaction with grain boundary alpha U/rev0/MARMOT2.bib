@article{homer2013hybrid,
	Abstract = {Abstract In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a hybrid model that combines elements of the Monte Carlo Potts Model with those of the phase field model. This hybrid model is introduced as a method to simulate microstructural evolution processes that are kinetically controlled by long-range diffusion in multi-component systems. The hybrid model uses a digitized microstructure with each site characterized by its microstructural features and its composition. The total free energy of the system is defined by bulk chemical free energy as well as interfacial energy. The coupling between the microstructure and composition is achieved by using the total free energy to drive the evolution in both fields. The kinetics are simulated by a combination of Monte Carlo methods and solution of the Cahn--Hilliard equation. This model is applied to several example problems to demonstrate its capabilities. These are diffusion in single- and two-phase diffusion couples, grain growth in a two-phase system controlled by diffusion and diffusion phase transformation by nucleation and growth of a second phase. },

abstract = {This work investigated brittle fracture of polycrystalline materials due to thermal stresses arising from anisotropic thermal expansion. We used phase-field fracture simulations with the properties of $\alpha$-uranium ($\alpha$-U) and assumed a linear elastic mechanical response. Three-dimensional simulations were used to predict fracture for various conditions and crystallographic textures. We found that fracture was more pronounced during cooling than during heating because the anisotropy increased with temperature. We also found that the total crack surface area increased with increasing average misorientation, while the net shape change of the material decreased with increasing misorientation. Two-dimensional simulations in which one crystallographic coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was set to zero indicated that the largest difference between the CTE in the three crystallographic directions dominates the fracture.}

abstract = {Alloys based on uranium-zirconium are gaining renewed interest as fuels for the Versatile Test Reactor and a number of microreactor designs. Implementing metallic fuel in reactors creates the need for robust descriptive and predictive fuel performance modeling. The current state of metallic fuel performance modeling relies on empirical equations derived from historical experiments, which may be unreliable when applied outside of their temperature, power, and composition phase space. One area where such data is lacking is the irradiation behavior of $\alpha$-U, specifically tearing and porosity formation at the early stages of irradiation. While grain boundaries likely play a key role in this fuel behavior, relatively little is known about grain boundaries in $\alpha$-U. Thus, we evaluate the grain boundary, surface energy, and work of adhesion of $\alpha$-U utilizing molecular dynamics. Symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) are analyzed with the tilt plane oriented along each major crystallographic axis, for a total of eighty unique grain boundaries. The effect of temperature, tilt plane, and misorientation angle on interfacial energies are analyzed. The interfacial energies typically increase with temperature and there is significant variance as a function of misorientation angle, irrespective of the tilt plane. At 500 K, the average surface energy (1.23 J/m2) is approximately 1.5 times the grain boundary energy (0.79 J/m2), and the work of adhesion is approximately twice the grain boundary energy (1.68 J/m2). Orientations for the likely formation of twins and likely failure planes are identified.}

abstract = {U3Si2 is an advanced fuel candidate due to its relatively high fissile density and attractive thermal properties. Compared to standard UO2 fuel, there are significant data gaps for the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of U3Si2. Point defect concentrations and mobilities under irradiation govern a number of important fuel performance properties, such as creep and fission gas release. In this work, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) data to inform a cluster dynamics framework to predict point defect concentrations in U3Si2 under irradiation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to examine the contribution of atomic mixing during ballistic cascades to diffusion, as well as the diffusivity of U and Si at grain boundaries. These atomic scale models for diffusivity were then used to inform a creep model based on bulk (Nabarro-Herring) and grain boundary (Coble) diffusional creep, and climb-limited dislocation creep. The model compares well against available experimental data and has been implemented in the BISON fuel performance code. A demonstration case using simple power profiles has been carried out, showing that negligible creep occurs due to the low temperatures experienced by U3Si2 in-reactor, a consequence of its high thermal conductivity.}

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we investigated the behavior of xenon (Xe) bubbles in uranium dioxide (UO2) grain boundaries using molecular dynamics simulations and compared it to that in the UO2 bulk. The results show that the formation energy of Xe clusters at the &Sigma;5 grain boundaries (GBs) is much lower than in the bulk. The diffusion activation energy of a single interstitial Xe atom at the GBs was approximately 1 eV lower than that in the bulk. Furthermore, the nucleation and growth of Xe bubbles in the &Sigma;5 GBs at 1000 and 2000 K were simulated. The volume and pressure of bubbles with different numbers of Xe atoms were simulated. The bubble pressure dropped with increasing temperature at low Xe concentrations, whereas the volume increased. The radial distribution function was computed to explore the configuration evolution of Xe bubbles. The bubble structures in the GB and bulk material at the same temperature were also compared. Xe atoms were more regular in the bulk, whereas multiple Xe atoms formed a planar structure at the GBs.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding irradiation damage and effects in &alpha;-uranium (&alpha;-U) is critical to modeling the behavior of U-based metallic fuels. The aim of this review is to address the renewed interest in U-based metallic fuels by examining the state-of-the-art knowledge associated with the effect of irradiation on the microstructure, dimensional changes, and properties of &alpha;-U. We critically review the research progress on irradiation-induced growth and swelling, the enhancement of plastic flow and superplasticity by irradiation, and the effect of irradiation on thermal and electrical properties of &alpha;-U. Finally, we outline the research directions that require advancements, specifically the need to carry out fundamental research on several of the less understood mechanisms of irradiation damage and effects in &alpha;-U.},
