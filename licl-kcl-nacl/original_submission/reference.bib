abstract = {We present a detailed description and comparison of algorithms for performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical calculations using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

abstract = {A calculation approach for redox potentials of metallic cations in molten salt is proposed by ensemble averages based on first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) and is applied to the calculation of the redox potentials of a series of metallic cations Mn+ (=Cu+, Tl+, Au+, La3+, Ce3+, U3+, and Pu3+) in molten LiCl-KCl eutectic versus reference electrode of Ag+|AgCl(s)|Ag(s) with satisfactory results. Special thermodynamic cycle is designed by using Ag+|AgCl(s)|Ag(s) as reference electrode and by enclosing the reduced metallic atoms in the molten salts, and thus the energies related to the chloride anions, as well as the absolute energies related metallic atoms or cations, are cancelled. In addition, self-diffusion coefficients of the cations, as well as ionic conductivities and viscosities of the molten salt mixtures are evaluated from FPMD. The significance and prospects of this approach and FPMD in the prediction of physicochemical properties of molten salt mixtures for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuels are discussed.},

abstract = {First principle molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations in combination with experimental measurements are applied to investigate the phase transition behavior of NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic salt from 823 to 573 K. First, the essential phase transition indexes of thermal expansion coefficient, density, melting point, and enthalpy of fusion for NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic obtained by simulations and experiments are in good agreement with each other. Second, the micro-structural characteristics during phase transition are depicted by the temperature dependences of angular distribution function, radial distribution function and coordination number. The structural evolution of NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic is illustrated from the rearrangement of polyhedral MgCln2-n clusters, and it is founded that high and low temperature are conducive to the formation of 4-fold and 6-fold coordinated structure, respectively. Third, the ionic self-diffusion coefficients for NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic are predicted and concluded that Mg2+ behaves like a complex than as a free ion resulting in less diffusivity. Therefore, the shear viscosities of molten NaCl-MgCl2 as well as the corresponding pre-exponential factor and activation energy are evaluated considering the solvodynamic mean radius of all the diffusive particles. Ultimately, two figures of merit for molten NaCl-MgCl2 are deduced to evaluate the heat-transfer and heat-loss performance by integrating multiple thermal properties including density, viscosity, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Overall, these simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with available reference data, indicating that the FPMD simulations work extremely well in predicting the thermophysical and structural properties of NaCl-MgCl2, which also provide insights for the applications of binary chloride salts in thermal energy storage.}

abstract = {A novel ternary eutectic salt mixture for high-temperature sensible heat storage, composed of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride (NaKMg–Cl) was developed based on a phase diagram generated with FactSage®. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique was used to experimentally validate the predicted melting point of the ternary eutectic composition, which was measured as 387 °C, in good agreement with the prediction. The ternary eutectic was compared to two binary salts formulated based on prediction of the eutectic composition by FactSage, but unfortunately DSC measurements showed that neither binary salt composition was eutectic. Nonetheless, the measured thermo-physical properties of the ternary and the two binary mixtures are compared. Liquid heat capacities of both the ternary and binary salts were determined by using DSC with sapphire as the standard reference. The average heat capacity of the ternary mixture was recorded as 1.18 J g−1 K−1. The mass loss of the molten eutectic salts was studied up to 1000 °C using a thermogravimetric analyser in nitrogen, argon and air. The results showed a significant mass loss due to vaporisation in an open system, particularly above 700 °C. However, simulation of mass loss in a closed system with an inert cover gas indicates storage temperatures above 700 °C may be feasible, and highlights the importance of the design of the storage tank system. In terms of storage material cost, the NaKMg-Cl mixture is approximately 4.5 USD/kWh, which is 60% cheaper than current state-of-the-art nitrate salt mixtures.}

The potentiometric measurements were performed at 298K, using a galvanic cell by combining a solvent polymeric sodium ion-selective membrane electrode (Na+ ISE), containing a mixture of N,N′-dibenzyl-N,N′-diphenyl-1,2-phenylene-dioxydiacetamide as ionophore, and an Ag/AgCl electrode. Different series of mixed salt solutions, each characterized by a fixed salt molal ratio r (r=mNaCl/mMgCl2=0.100, 0.199, 0.995, 4.990 and 10.364) but with similar ionic strengths, were used in this investigation. The modeling of the ternary electrolyte system was based on the Pitzer ion-interaction semi-empirical theory for mixed salts, over the ionic strength ranging from 0.05 to 4.3mol/kg. Pitzer ion-interaction parameters for mixed salts including the effect of the higher-order electrostatic terms were determined for this system. Moreover, based on the potentiometric experimental data and the determined mixing parameters, the values of the mean activity coefficients, the osmotic coefficients, the excess Gibbs free energies and the water activities (aw) were reported for the whole series of the studied ternary mixed electrolyte systems. Finally, the impact of the magnitude of the potentiometric selectivity coefficient of this Na+ ISE on the quality of the potentiometric data revealed that Nernst equation could suitably be used for the evaluation of mean activity coefficients (with at least 3 decimal numbers), for the ionic strength beyond 0.25mol/kg and for mixed electrolyte systems with molal salt ratio higher than r=mNaCl/mMgCl2≥5.}

Despite the environmental destructive operations to produce rare earth elements, limited life cycle assessment investigations have yet been carried out. This is specifically true regarding the reduction of rare earth compounds to produce rare earth metals and alloys. In combination with mass/energy balance and stoichiometry, life cycle inventories of molten slat electrolysis process were developed in this study using industrial datasets gathered from different facilities in China and the Ecoinvent v3 database. The results showed that although mining, chemical treatment, and solvent extraction stages are the dominant contributors to the whole neodymium metal production process for most impact categories, molten salt electrolysis significantly impacts ecotoxicity, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and eutrophication categories. Moreover, neodymium fluoride production, electricity consumption, and molybdenum use in cathodes are the dominant contributors in the molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, the neodymium metal production at facilities which produce larger amounts of heavy rare earth metals/alloys demonstrates relatively lower impacts on all impact categories compared to the production of neodymium metal at refining facilities which produce light rare earth metals/alloys.}

Facile synthesis of single-crystal 2D layered transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) is of crucial importance for the development of forthcoming technologies, such as superconducting, electromagnetic interference shielding, and energy-related applications. However, the fabrication of TMNs with natural 2D layered structure is thermodynamically difficult, in which stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employed alkali molten salts as catalysts to achieve facile and large-scale (over decagram) synthesis of a family of 2D layered TMNs, such as MoN1.2, WN1.5, and Mo0.7W0.3N1.2, under atmospheric pressure. Ex-situ experiments reveal that the molten salt can lower the formation energy of 2D layered TMNs by assuring a liquid-gas synthesis and forming a TMN-salt-TMN superstructure as an intermediate. The resultant 2D layered TMNs show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the immense potential of 2D layered TMNs for energy-related applications and beyond.}

The results show that molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity and long-term stability up to 1000 min time on stream without any deactivation. The carbon products over the molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are in the form of small granular particles instead of filamentous carbon for the catalyst without molten salt. The promotional effect of the molten salt may attribute to the higher wettability of the Fe–Ni alloy by molten salt, which can prevent the catalysts from deactivation due to carbon encapsulation.}

abstract = {Fluoride salts and their interactions with metals are of wide interest for the nuclear community. In this work, first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) was employed to study both pure molten fluoride salt and fluoride salt with dissolved solute Cr ions (a common corrosion product) at high temperature (823–1423K). Two types of molten fluoride salts, namely flibe (LiF–BeF2) and flinak (LiF–NaF–KF), with the Cr0, Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions were chosen as a target system for the FPMD modeling. The prediction of thermo-kinetic properties of pure fluoride salt, such as the equilibrium volume, density, bulk modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, and self-diffusion coefficient, provide useful extensions of existing data and verify the accuracy of the FPMD simulation in modeling of fluoride salts. The FPMD modeling of solute Cr in fluoride salt shows the effect of Cr valence on diffusivity and local structure in the salt.}

abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are envisioned as a potential pathway to safer, more economical nuclear electricity generation and supply of industrial heat. MSRs under consideration today are either solid-fueled salt-cooled designs or liquid-salt-fueled designs with chloride or fluoride based salts. A significant knowledge gap exists in the data for the fundamental properties relevant to fuels and coolants for MSRs that needs to be addressed in order to expedite the technical readiness level of the MSR design concepts. With the rapid development and improvement of computational materials science, computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations are widely used as an effective and reliable tool to investigate the atomic interaction in materials. In this article, the density of the LiCl-KCl system was determined via AIMD calculations and verified using new experimental analyses. AIMD was further utilized to calculate the compressibility, heat capacity, enthalpy of mixing, and Gibbs free energy of mixing. This work spans a wider range of compositions and temperatures than have previously been explored computationally for this pseudo-binary system and provides the basis for further advanced thermophysical property evaluation utilizing AIMD methods.}
