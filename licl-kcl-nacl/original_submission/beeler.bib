abstract  ="This review covers the local structure of molten metal halide{,} where a somewhat wide definition of “local structure” is employed{,} i.e. from the first shell of interacting neighbours up to correlations arising at the nanometer length scale. These particular liquids are indeed strongly organized at unusually long distances due to the predominance of coulombic interactions. Many of them are also characterized by the formation of intermediate range ordering. It is therefore impossible to describe the local structure of these liquids omitting this longer-ranged correlation. Finally{,} a deeper attention is given to the systems on which recent progresses have been made in the last decade{,} as for instance molten fluorides and rare earth halides."}

abstract = {Comprehensive molecular simulations have been carried out to compute local structures and transport properties of different components of binary NaCl-KCl over a wide operating temperature range. The partial radial distribution functions, coordination number curves and angular distribution functions were calculated to analyze the influence of temperature and component on local structures of molten Alkali Chlorides. Transport properties were calculated by using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulations including densities, shear viscosity and thermal conductivity. The results show that ion clusters are considered to be formed and the distance of ion clusters become larger with increasing temperature which has great influence on macro-properties. The calculated properties have a good agreement with the experimental data, and similar method could be used to computationally calculate the properties of various molten salts and their mixtures.}

	abstract = {Properties of molten salts are of interest for a wide-range of applications, including nuclear waste partitioning, heat transfer fluids, and synthesis methods. While there has been extensive work showing the value of molecular modeling with interatomic potentials to predict molten salt properties there have been very limited studies of molten salts from a fully first-principles approach. In order to establish optimal approaches and their strengths and limitations in first-principles molten salt modeling, this work provides extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the LiCl--KCl molten salt system that are validated against existing literature. The basic thermokinetic properties of volume, thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and diffusivity, are calculated for LiCl, KCl and the eutectic LiCl--KCl liquids at multiple temperatures. Convergence testing reveals 216-atom unit cells and simulation times of 6--12ps are sufficient to provide results with acceptable uncertainties and agreement with experimental data. The results provide a framework of first principles molecular dynamics simulations in the LiCl--KCl molten salt system that can be extended in future research to predict less well-established properties, e.g., the behavior of solutes.},

@article{Grimme,
	abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ``zero-damping'' formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Li2020,
	abstract = {Molten chlorides are a good choice for fast-spectrum molten salt reactors, but many of their thermophysical and transport properties are not available. In this work we use classical molecular dynamics simulations based on the polarizable-ion model to investigate the structural and transport properties of NaCl-UCl3 at various U3+ mole fractions. Molar volume, coordination structure and number, network structure, heat capacity, diffusivity, and ion conductivity have been simulated. We find strong variation of the second coordination shells (U-U and Cl-Cl) with U3+ mole fraction. This is consistent with the increasing network formation or oligomerization of UCl63− and UCl74− units via shared Cl− ions. The movement of Cl− is strongly coupled with U3+ as the U-Cl network structures become dominant in the mixture when the mole fraction of UCl3 is >0.25. Evaluation of a heat-transfer figure-of-merit suggests that 0.20 to 0.30 is an optimal mole fraction of UCl3 to achieve both lower operating temperatures and better heat transfer.},

A further improvement is to consider electronic correlation effects due to tightly bound and localized d-states on the transition metal atoms. With the DFT + U method used in this work, these correlation effects are taken in account and yield improved predictions for volume, magnetic moment, exchange splitting and bandgap. For MnS the semiconducting gap is correctly predicted, and for MnS2 the high-spin AFM type-III state can be stabilized over the low-spin state. For FeS even weak correlation effects lead to better predictions for the semiconducting gap, volume and magnetic moment.},

	abstract = {The first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations are applied to the study of LiCl-KCl eutectic and UCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic. The densities of the molten salt mixtures are optimized by FPMD simulations in NVT ensemble, and the local coordination structures are evaluated in terms of radial distribution functions and partial static structure factors. Both self-diffusion coefficients and ion conductivities are evaluated from the mean square displacements using Einstein relation for diffusion coefficients. It is conformed that the FPMD simulations give satisfactory structural and transport characteristics compared with experimental observations. Therefore, the predictability of FPMD simulations for structural and transport characteristics of molten salt mixtures is confirmed, and the FPMD simulations can be useful measurement in the establishment of database of actinide behavior in molten salt mixtures essential for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuels.},

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

Special thermodynamic cycle is designed by using Ag+|AgCl(s)|Ag(s) as reference electrode and by enclosing the reduced metallic atoms in the molten salts, and thus the energies related to the chloride anions, as well as the absolute energies related metallic atoms or cations, are cancelled. In addition, self-diffusion coefficients of the cations, as well as ionic conductivities and viscosities of the molten salt mixtures are evaluated from FPMD. The significance and prospects of this approach and FPMD in the prediction of physicochemical properties of molten salt mixtures for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuels are discussed.},

	abstract = {First principle molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations in combination with experimental measurements are applied to investigate the phase transition behavior of NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic salt from 823 to 573 K. First, the essential phase transition indexes of thermal expansion coefficient, density, melting point, and enthalpy of fusion for NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic obtained by simulations and experiments are in good agreement with each other. Second, the micro-structural characteristics during phase transition are depicted by the temperature dependences of angular distribution function, radial distribution function and coordination number. The structural evolution of NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic is illustrated from the rearrangement of polyhedral MgCln2-n clusters, and it is founded that high and low temperature are conducive to the formation of 4-fold and 6-fold coordinated structure, respectively. Third, the ionic self-diffusion coefficients for NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic are predicted and concluded that Mg2+ behaves like a complex than as a free ion resulting in less diffusivity. Therefore, the shear viscosities of molten NaCl-MgCl2 as well as the corresponding pre-exponential factor and activation energy are evaluated considering the solvodynamic mean radius of all the diffusive particles. Ultimately, two figures of merit for molten NaCl-MgCl2 are deduced to evaluate the heat-transfer and heat-loss performance by integrating multiple thermal properties including density, viscosity, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Overall, these simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with available reference data, indicating that the FPMD simulations work extremely well in predicting the thermophysical and structural properties of NaCl-MgCl2, which also provide insights for the applications of binary chloride salts in thermal energy storage.},

	abstract = {A novel ternary eutectic salt mixture for high-temperature sensible heat storage, composed of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride (NaKMg--Cl) was developed based on a phase diagram generated with FactSage{\textregistered}. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique was used to experimentally validate the predicted melting point of the ternary eutectic composition, which was measured as 387 $\,^{\circ}$C, in good agreement with the prediction. The ternary eutectic was compared to two binary salts formulated based on prediction of the eutectic composition by FactSage, but unfortunately DSC measurements showed that neither binary salt composition was eutectic. Nonetheless, the measured thermo-physical properties of the ternary and the two binary mixtures are compared. Liquid heat capacities of both the ternary and binary salts were determined by using DSC with sapphire as the standard reference. The average heat capacity of the ternary mixture was recorded as 1.18 J g−1 K−1. The mass loss of the molten eutectic salts was studied up to 1000 $\,^{\circ}$C using a thermogravimetric analyser in nitrogen, argon and air. The results showed a significant mass loss due to vaporisation in an open system, particularly above 700 $\,^{\circ}$C. However, simulation of mass loss in a closed system with an inert cover gas indicates storage temperatures above 700 $\,^{\circ}$C may be feasible, and highlights the importance of the design of the storage tank system. In terms of storage material cost, the NaKMg-Cl mixture is approximately 4.5 USD/kWh, which is 60% cheaper than current state-of-the-art nitrate salt mixtures.},

	abstract = {This work reports the results of a thermodynamic investigation of the ternary NaCl--MgCl2--H2O mixed electrolyte system. The potentiometric measurements were performed at 298K, using a galvanic cell by combining a solvent polymeric sodium ion-selective membrane electrode (Na+ ISE), containing a mixture of N,N′-dibenzyl-N,N′-diphenyl-1,2-phenylene-dioxydiacetamide as ionophore, and an Ag/AgCl electrode. Different series of mixed salt solutions, each characterized by a fixed salt molal ratio r (r=mNaCl/mMgCl2=0.100, 0.199, 0.995, 4.990 and 10.364) but with similar ionic strengths, were used in this investigation. The modeling of the ternary electrolyte system was based on the Pitzer ion-interaction semi-empirical theory for mixed salts, over the ionic strength ranging from 0.05 to 4.3mol/kg. Pitzer ion-interaction parameters for mixed salts including the effect of the higher-order electrostatic terms were determined for this system. Moreover, based on the potentiometric experimental data and the determined mixing parameters, the values of the mean activity coefficients, the osmotic coefficients, the excess Gibbs free energies and the water activities (aw) were reported for the whole series of the studied ternary mixed electrolyte systems.

Despite the environmental destructive operations to produce rare earth elements, limited life cycle assessment investigations have yet been carried out. This is specifically true regarding the reduction of rare earth compounds to produce rare earth metals and alloys. In combination with mass/energy balance and stoichiometry, life cycle inventories of molten slat electrolysis process were developed in this study using industrial datasets gathered from different facilities in China and the Ecoinvent v3 database. The results showed that although mining, chemical treatment, and solvent extraction stages are the dominant contributors to the whole neodymium metal production process for most impact categories, molten salt electrolysis significantly impacts ecotoxicity, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and eutrophication categories. Moreover, neodymium fluoride production, electricity consumption, and molybdenum use in cathodes are the dominant contributors in the molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, the neodymium metal production at facilities which produce larger amounts of heavy rare earth metals/alloys demonstrates relatively lower impacts on all impact categories compared to the production of neodymium metal at refining facilities which produce light rare earth metals/alloys.},

	abstract = {Summary
Facile synthesis of single-crystal 2D layered transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) is of crucial importance for the development of forthcoming technologies, such as superconducting, electromagnetic interference shielding, and energy-related applications. However, the fabrication of TMNs with natural 2D layered structure is thermodynamically difficult, in which stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employed alkali molten salts as catalysts to achieve facile and large-scale (over decagram) synthesis of a family of 2D layered TMNs, such as MoN1.2, WN1.5, and Mo0.7W0.3N1.2, under atmospheric pressure. Ex-situ experiments reveal that the molten salt can lower the formation energy of 2D layered TMNs by assuring a liquid-gas synthesis and forming a TMN-salt-TMN superstructure as an intermediate. The resultant 2D layered TMNs show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the immense potential of 2D layered TMNs for energy-related applications and beyond.},

The catalysts and carbon products were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS, XRF and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The results show that molten salt-promoted Ni--Fe/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity and long-term stability up to 1000 min time on stream without any deactivation. The carbon products over the molten salt-promoted Ni--Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are in the form of small granular particles instead of filamentous carbon for the catalyst without molten salt. The promotional effect of the molten salt may attribute to the higher wettability of the Fe--Ni alloy by molten salt, which can prevent the catalysts from deactivation due to carbon encapsulation.},

In this work, first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) was employed to study both pure molten fluoride salt and fluoride salt with dissolved solute Cr ions (a common corrosion product) at high temperature (823--1423K). Two types of molten fluoride salts, namely flibe (LiF--BeF2) and flinak (LiF--NaF--KF), with the Cr0, Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions were chosen as a target system for the FPMD modeling. The prediction of thermo-kinetic properties of pure fluoride salt, such as the equilibrium volume, density, bulk modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, and self-diffusion coefficient, provide useful extensions of existing data and verify the accuracy of the FPMD simulation in modeling of fluoride salts. The FPMD modeling of solute Cr in fluoride salt shows the effect of Cr valence on diffusivity and local structure in the salt.},

A significant knowledge gap exists in the data for the fundamental properties relevant to fuels and coolants for MSRs that needs to be addressed in order to expedite the technical readiness level of the MSR design concepts. With the rapid development and improvement of computational materials science, computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations are widely used as an effective and reliable tool to investigate the atomic interaction in materials.

This work spans a wider range of compositions and temperatures than have previously been explored computationally for this pseudo-binary system and provides the basis for further advanced thermophysical property evaluation utilizing AIMD methods.},
