abstract = {The electrochemical reduction process has been used to reduce spent oxide fuel to a metallic form using pyroprocessing technology for a closed fuel cycle in combination with a metal-fuel fast reactor. In the electrochemical reduction process, oxides fuels are loaded at the cathode basket in molten Li2O–LiCl salt and electrochemically reduced to the metal form. Various approaches based on thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies have been used to understand the electrode reaction and efficiently treat spent fuels. The factors that affect the speed of the electrochemical reduction have been determined to optimize the process and scale-up the electrolysis cell. In addition, demonstrations of the integrated series of processes (electrorefining and salt distillation) with the electrochemical reduction have been conducted to realize the oxide fuel cycle. This overview provides insight into the current status of and issues related to the electrochemical processing of spent nuclear fuels.}

Despite the environmental destructive operations to produce rare earth elements, limited life cycle assessment investigations have yet been carried out. This is specifically true regarding the reduction of rare earth compounds to produce rare earth metals and alloys. In combination with mass/energy balance and stoichiometry, life cycle inventories of molten slat electrolysis process were developed in this study using industrial datasets gathered from different facilities in China and the Ecoinvent v3 database. The results showed that although mining, chemical treatment, and solvent extraction stages are the dominant contributors to the whole neodymium metal production process for most impact categories, molten salt electrolysis significantly impacts ecotoxicity, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and eutrophication categories. Moreover, neodymium fluoride production, electricity consumption, and molybdenum use in cathodes are the dominant contributors in the molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, the neodymium metal production at facilities which produce larger amounts of heavy rare earth metals/alloys demonstrates relatively lower impacts on all impact categories compared to the production of neodymium metal at refining facilities which produce light rare earth metals/alloys.}

abstract = {Summary
Facile synthesis of single-crystal 2D layered transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) is of crucial importance for the development of forthcoming technologies, such as superconducting, electromagnetic interference shielding, and energy-related applications. However, the fabrication of TMNs with natural 2D layered structure is thermodynamically difficult, in which stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employed alkali molten salts as catalysts to achieve facile and large-scale (over decagram) synthesis of a family of 2D layered TMNs, such as MoN1.2, WN1.5, and Mo0.7W0.3N1.2, under atmospheric pressure. Ex-situ experiments reveal that the molten salt can lower the formation energy of 2D layered TMNs by assuring a liquid-gas synthesis and forming a TMN-salt-TMN superstructure as an intermediate. The resultant 2D layered TMNs show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the immense potential of 2D layered TMNs for energy-related applications and beyond.}

The catalysts and carbon products were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS, XRF and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The results show that molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity and long-term stability up to 1000 min time on stream without any deactivation. The carbon products over the molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are in the form of small granular particles instead of filamentous carbon for the catalyst without molten salt. The promotional effect of the molten salt may attribute to the higher wettability of the Fe–Ni alloy by molten salt, which can prevent the catalysts from deactivation due to carbon encapsulation.}

Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.}

A brief overview of the model followed by results from simulations performed to validate the model is presented. Simulations illustrate stable behavior of the reactor dynamics and temperature feedback effects to reactivity excursions. Stable and smooth changes at various nodal temperatures are also observed. Control strategies for molten-salt reactor operation are discussed, followed by an illustration of the open-loop load-following capability of the molten-salt breeder reactor system. It is observed that the molten-salt breeder reactor system exhibits “self-regulating” behavior, minimizing the need for external controller action for load-following maneuvers.}

The enthalpy of mixing of the (Li,Th)Fx liquid solution was measured for the first time using a method designed for conventional DSC technique. To verify the possibility to measure the mixing enthalpy with the used calorimeter, the known LiF–KF system was first investigated and compared to the literature data. After the successful test, this technique was applied to investigate the LiF–ThF4 system and obtained novel results are presented in this study. Furthermore, using the DSC technique, new equilibrium data of the LiF–ThF4 phase diagram were measured, confirming the stability of the LiThF5 phase. The intermediate compound Li3ThF7 was synthesized and its enthalpy of fusion was determined. Considering the new experimental data, the LiF–ThF4 system was re-optimized using a quasi chemical model for the description of excess Gibbs parameters of the liquid solution.}

This paper demonstrated that the interaction between high purity nuclear grade graphite IG-110 and molten salt mixture 2LiF-BeF2 (FLiBe) at 700 °C for twelve hours in argon envirnoment resulted in graphite fluorination and changes in graphite microstructure. XPS C1s spectra analysis shows an increase in F functionalization (from 3.5% to 9.0–19.3%), an increase in the sp3/sp2 ratio (from 0.1496 to 0.1798), and F1s spectrum analysis confirms appearance of CF bonds. Raman spectra show an increase in ID/IG ratio from 0.35 to 0.69 and an appearance of peak shoulders characteristic of CF bond formation. GDMS depth analysis from the surface to 5 μm depth shows a higher depth penetration of F compared to that of Li and Be, indicative of surface salt reduction and bulk graphite fluorination. FLiBe reduction by graphite fluorination is not thermodynamically favorable, but certain carbon sites in the graphite are more reactive than the majority of carbon atoms in graphite. We argue that graphite fluorination occurred at these reactive sites, leading to the reduction of salt at the graphite surface. XRD and Raman confirmed microstructural changes. This indicates that the fluorination process may introduce new active sites as existing active sites are consumed, which could be advantageous for tritium chemisorption from FLiBe.

abstract = {To develop a potential salt in a solar power generation system, several properties must be determined including heat capacity, thermal conductivity, density and viscosity over the entire operating temperature range, which is really difficult to be obtained from experimental measurement due to high-temperature extreme conditions. It is desired to look for an alternative way to predict these properties accurately for molten salts design and relative heat transfer enhancement in high-temperature energy storage systems. In this study, thermal and transport properties for chloride salts including lithium, sodium, and potassium cations were computed by molecular simulations. The Born–Mayer–Huggins pair potential [1,2] with parameters obtained by Tosi, Fumi, etc. was taken as the interaction between ions in the simulation. Densities for the liquid phases calculated from simulations were underestimated by 9.0{\%} of the experimental values, while heat capacities were overestimated by 5.0{\%}. A RNEMD method was proposed to calculate viscosities and thermal conductivities. Compared with conventional EMD and NEMD simulation method, RNEMD got more accurate results in a shorter time. Thermal conductivity calculated from RNEMD show a 30.0{\%} deviation between simulation and experiment for LiCl, 8.1{\%} for NaCl and 6.0{\%} for KCl, respectively, while viscosity calculated from the same method show a 5.8{\%} deviation between simulation and experiment for LiCl, 5.2{\%} for NaCl and 5.7{\%} for KCl. The relationship between microstructure and macroscopic properties was discussed subsequently. The BMHTF force field adopted in this study had been proved to be reasonable to compute the properties of molten alkali chloride salts including thermal conductivities, heat capacities, viscosities, and densities, which could be used in future work to predict the properties of other molten salts and their mixtures.},

abstract = {The structures and dynamic properties of molten alkali binary chlorides LiCl–NaCl, LiCl–KCl and KCl–NaCl at 1100K have been calculated across the full composition range in this paper in detail by molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of LiCl on the local structures and transport properties as the self-diffusion coefficients, viscosities and ionic conductivities of molten NaCl and KCl as well as the mixing effects between NaCl and KCl have been calculated and analyzed. The results reveal that the Tosi-Fumi potential predicts negative composition dependence for density and positive composition dependences for ionic diffusivity and ionic conductivity as the contents of LiCl are increased for molten LiCl–NaCl and LiCl–KCl. As the KCl contents are increased, the ionic diffusivity of molten KCl–NaCl shows weak composition dependence. However, the density and ionic conductivity exhibit negative composition dependences. The transport performances of these mixed melts are dominated by the local structures and interatomic forces. The shear viscosities of the mixtures decrease firstly and then increase under the influences of these two factors. For molten KCl or NaCl, with the addition of a smaller cation (Li+), the interactions between counter ions and closed packs between anions are weakened, while closed packs between cations are promoted. What's more, the smaller the added ion is, the more pronounced the effects are. However, the addition of a larger cation presents the opposite effects.},

ABSTRACT = {We report experimental constraints on the melting curve of potassium chloride (KCl) between 3.2 and 9 GPa from in situ ionic conduction measurements using a multi-anvil apparatus. On the basis of concurrent measurements of KCl and sodium chloride (NaCl) at 1 bar using the differential thermal analysis (DTA) method and Pt sphere marker, we show that the peak rate of increase in ionic current with temperature upon heating coincides with latent heat ledge and fall of Pt sphere, thus establishing the criterion for melting detection from ionic conduction measurements. Applying this criterion to high pressures, we found that the melting point of KCl rose steeply with increasing pressure to exceed 2443 &plusmn; 100 K at 9 GPa. Fitting the results of this study together with existing data at pressures below 4 GPa and above 20 GPa, we obtained the Simon&rsquo;s melting equation for KCl in the simple cubic B2 structure between 1.8 and 50 GPa:      T m  = 1323    (    P &minus; 1.87   2.2  ( 1 )    + 1  )     1  2.7  ( 1 )         , where T is in K and P is in GPa. Starting at 1 bar, the melting point of KCl increases at an average rate of ~150 K/GPa to cross that of Pt near 9 GPa. The highly refractory nature of KCl makes it a sensitive pressure calibrant for the large-volume pressure at moderate pressures and a potential sample container for experiments at moderate pressures and very high temperatures.},

abstract = {Molten salt mixtures are integral part of highly important technological applications such as nuclear reactors. However, due to inherent difficulties associated with experiment at high temperatures and the intrinsic complexity of liquid-phase multi-component systems, understanding their properties at a molecular level remains a challenge. Here, we report on an ab initio molecular dynamics investigation on structural, electronic, transport, and thermal properties of two common molten salt mixtures, (K, Li)Cl and (K,Na)Cl, at five different compositions and three temperatures. Most of the properties were found to depend on both composition and temperature. While properties, like atomic charges, show additive behaviors, other properties, such as electrical conductivity, show considerable deviations from additivity. We shall show that the mixing of the molten salt mixtures is mainly driven by entropy, and that the KCl and LiCl mix better than KCl and NaCl. Our computational results are in general consistent with available experimental data. Comparison with available theoretical data is also provided.}

abstract = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Since the viscosity and density are most fundamental properties for any fluids, many efforts to obtain reliable values have been made. However, the measurements are not so easy, especially at high temperature in molten state. The high temperature melts are typically classified into molten metals, molten salts, and molten oxides. They appear in many industrial processes, for example, steelmaking, nonferrous metallurgy, aluminum smelting, foundry, glass making, etc. The adaptable methods for the measurements should be chosen carefully by considering some physical and chemical properties of the melt. Iida published the review on the properties including viscosity and density of molten metals [1], and the comparison among the viscosities of molten iron reported by many researchers showed considerable difference of several dozen percent. The viscosity value is in considerably wide range depending on the groups of the melts, for example, in general low for molten metals and high for molten silicates, including slag and glass, and the difference reaches more than ten orders by reflecting the difference in the melt structure. On the other hand, density is mainly depending on atomic mass and not so different to each other because of not so big difference in molar volumes of the components. Various methods for viscosity and density measurement were also introduced [2] and also the viscometries were summarized [3].},

The chapter is divided into ten different sections and starts with an introduction (Section 3.13.1), in which the general characteristics of the MSR are described. This is followed by a report (Section 3.13.2) on the historical developments of this reactor concept, with the main emphasis on the work performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s and 1970s. Section 3.13.3 briefly explains the current MSR concepts and their applications as either breeder designs or actinide burner concepts in the management of the long-lived actinides. Section 3.13.4 summarizes the physicochemical properties of typical fuels and coolants, based on the critical evaluation of available experimental data of the fluoride systems. This section is divided into several subsections based on the properties discussed, giving first a brief description of the structure of the fluoride liquids, followed by the description of various phase diagrams. Furthermore, the solubility of actinide fluorides in the fuel matrix is given, as well as information about the density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the vapor pressure. One of the key issues is the understanding of the fuel behavior under irradiating conditions. This is briefly discussed in Section 3.13.7. Section 3.13.8 is related to the fission products and their behavior in the fluoride fuel matrix with respect to their solubility, and Section 3.13.9 addresses the corrosion effects of the fuel salt on the structural materials.}

Investigating the structure and thermodynamic transport properties of this eutectic mixed with fission waste cations will provide a better understanding of the reprocessing progress. In this study, molecular dynamic simulations were performed on the molten salts of a LiCl–KCl eutectic mixed with La3+, U3+, or Sc3+ cations, and the mole fractions of the trivalent cations ranged from 0% to 50% at 773 K, 873 K, and 973 K. The local structures (in nearest neighbor distance and coordination numbers) and macroscopic transport properties (self-diffusion, electrical conductivity, and viscosity coefficients) of the three systems have been studied. When the trivalent cation concentration varied from 0 mol% to 50 mol%, the mean nearest neighbor distance of La3+–Cl- and U3+–Cl- increased and the mean nearest neighbor distance of Sc3+–Cl- decreased, and the coordination numbers of La3+ and U3+ increased while the coordination numbers of Sc3+ decreased as the trivalent cation concentrations increased. The trivalent cations were primarily present in the form of [MClx]3−x in diluted mixtures, and they linked to form a network in the viscous regions. The viscosity was primarily affected by the network and followed by a nearly linear increase with the degree of the network in the arbitrary trivalent mixtures. Additional investigation predicted the electrical conductivity and self-diffusion over a broader range; the results indicated that the electrical conductivities were hardly affected by the radius of the given trivalent cation.}
