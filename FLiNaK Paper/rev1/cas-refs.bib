abstract = {A semi-empirical Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential is developed for application to the high temperature body-centered-cubic uranium–zirconium alloy (γ-U–Zr) phase and employed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the high temperature thermo-physical properties of U–Zr alloys. Uranium-rich U–Zr alloys (e.g. U–10Zr) have been tested and qualified for use as metallic nuclear fuel in U.S. fast reactors such as the Integral Fast Reactor and the Experimental Breeder Reactors, and are a common sub-system of ternary metallic alloys like U–Pu–Zr and U–Zr–Nb. The potential was constructed to ensure that basic properties (e.g., elastic constants, bulk modulus, and formation energies) were in agreement with first principles calculations and experimental results. After which, slight adjustments were made to the potential to fit the known thermal properties and thermodynamics of the system. The potentials successfully reproduce the experimental melting point, enthalpy of fusion, volume change upon melting, thermal expansion, and the heat capacity of pure U and Zr. Simulations of the U–Zr system are found to be in good agreement with experimental thermal expansion values, Vegard's law for the lattice constants, and the experimental enthalpy of mixing. This is the first simulation to reproduce the experimental thermodynamics of the high temperature γ-U–Zr metallic alloy system. The MEAM potential is then used to explore thermodynamics properties of the high temperature U–Zr system including the constant volume heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, adiabatic index, and the Grüneisen parameters.}

	abstract = {{To optimize the efficiency and safety of molten salt-based energy applications, accurate molten salt thermophysical property data are required. For molten fluorides, existing thermal conductivity results have large uncertainties and contradict the current theory by eliciting a positive temperature coefficient. Transient grating spectroscopy (TGS), a technique previously deemed reliable by the theoretical community, has been used to measure the thermal conductivity of fluorides (FLiNaK) for the first time. Results show a fairly flat but slightly increasing thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. The technique has been shown to not suffer from contributions from convection and radiation, an explanation used to discount the results of alternative experimental techniques. In addition to thermal conductivity, sound speed data as a function of temperature have also been obtained for the first time in FLiNaK. The use of accurate sound speed data in theoretical models of thermal conductivity provides better but not complete agreement with the results from TGS. The continued existence of a positive temperature coefficient highlights the need for new mechanistic proposals for why TGS, or current theoretical models, are unable to capture the correct temperature dependence for fluoride molten salt thermal conductivity.}},

	abstract = {Molten salt mixtures are integral part of highly important technological applications such as nuclear reactors. However, due to inherent difficulties associated with experiment at high temperatures and the intrinsic complexity of liquid-phase multi-component systems, understanding their properties at a molecular level remains a challenge. Here, we report on an ab initio molecular dynamics investigation on structural, electronic, transport, and thermal properties of two common molten salt mixtures, (K, Li)Cl and (K,Na)Cl, at five different compositions and three temperatures. Most of the properties were found to depend on both composition and temperature. While properties, like atomic charges, show additive behaviors, other properties, such as electrical conductivity, show considerable deviations from additivity. We shall show that the mixing of the molten salt mixtures is mainly driven by entropy, and that the KCl and LiCl mix better than KCl and NaCl. Our computational results are in general consistent with available experimental data. Comparison with available theoretical data is also provided.},

@article{Packmol,
	abstract = {Abstract Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

While molten salts show promising properties for these applications, there still exists a knowledge gap for the transport properties of molten salts at elevated temperatures. This work uses ab initio Molecular Dynamics to investigate the transport properties of KCl, LiCl, KCl-LiCl eutectic, NaCl, MgCl2, and NaCl-MgCl2 eutectic molten salt systems. The properties presented here are the diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and isochoric heat capacity. These properties are compared to experimental data where available and other computational work in cases where no experimental data is available. This is the first work to explore timescales over 100 ps via AIMD for the determination of transport properties in molten salts.}

abstract = {Molten salts and molten salt mixtures (will be referred as molten salts for convenience) are important heat storage media and heat transfer fluids for concentrated solar power plants and molten salt reactors. Besides the heat capacity, the thermal conductivity, and the thermal and chemical stability, the viscosity is also widely studied by experimental measurements and theoretical predictions because of the importance in engineering applications. In this work, the experimental viscosities of molten salts are compiled from literatures, and a novel empirical equation is proposed for the prediction of the temperature dependence of viscosity of molten salts. This novel empirical equation extends the Arrhenius equation with three empirical parameters and performs better than the Arrhenius equation for the applications to fluorides, chlorides, nitrates, and carbonates. Finally, its physical basis is discussed and the empirical parameters are recommended for molten salts with experimental viscosity being reported in literatures.}

	abstract = {Molten salts have many applications in the nuclear and solar energy industries for thermal storage and heat transfer applications. However, there is a knowledge gap in molten salt thermophysical properties which hinders the technical readiness level of molten salt applications, especially in the nuclear industry. A common method of investigating new materials is through ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations which is an effective tool to investigate structural and thermophysical properties at realistic temperatures. NaCl-MgCl2 is an inexpensive salt that is a good candidate for use as a heat transfer medium in solar power applications or in the secondary loop of a nuclear reactor. In this article, the thermophysical properties of NaCl-MgCl2 are computed via AIMD calculations to supplement the limited experimental studies in the literature. A wide range of compositions and temperatures for the pseudo-binary NaCl-MgCl2 were used to calculate the density, heat capacity, compressibility, enthalpy of mixing, and volumetric thermal expansion coefficient. AIMD is shown to accurately model the densities of molten NaCl-MgCl2 as there is good agreement with the available literature. This work observed a transition to a monotonic increase of the density with respect to MgCl2 composition occurring above 1100 K. The heat capacity values increase uniformly with respect to concentration of MgCl2 at a rate of 2.85 J/mol-K per 10 mol\% of MgCl2. Select thermophysical properties are fit to a Redlich-Kister expansion for utilization in multiphysics simulations.},

AIMD was further utilized to calculate the compressibility, heat capacity, enthalpy of mixing, and Gibbs free energy of mixing. This work spans a wider range of compositions and temperatures than have previously been explored computationally for this pseudo-binary system and provides the basis for further advanced thermophysical property evaluation utilizing AIMD methods.},

Heat, electrically generated in the tube wall was transferred uniformly to the fluid during passage through small-diameter tubes of nickel, Inconel, and 316 stainless steel. The variables involved: Reynolds modulus (N/sub R//sub e/), 2300 to 9500; Prandtl modulus (N/sub P//sub r/, 1.6 to 4.0; average fluid temperatures, 980 to 1370 deg F; and heat flux, 9,000 to 192,000 Btu/hr-ft/sup 2/. Forced-convection heat transfer with Flinak can be represented by the general correlation for heat transfer with ordinary fluids (0.5 < N /sub P//sub r/< 100). The existence of an interfacial resistance in Flinak-Inconel systems was established and its composition determined. Preliminary measurements of thermal conductivity and thickness of film were made. The results verify the effect of the film on Flinak heat transfer in small-diameter Inconel tubes. Thermal entry lengths, determined from variations of local heat transfer coefficients in the entrance of the heated section, were correlated with the Peclet modulus. (auth)},

Thermodynamic properties of four types of molten salts, including LiF-BeF2 (67 and 33 mol\%, respectively; also known as FLiBe), LiF-NaF-KF (46.5, 11.5, and 52 mol\%, also known as FLiNaK), and KCl-MgCl2 (67 and 33 mol\%), and sodium nitrate-sodium nitrite-potassium nitrate (NaNO3--NaNO2--KNO3, (7-49-44 or 7-40-53 mol\%) have been investigated. Limitations of existing correlations to predict density, viscosity, specific heat capacity, surface tension, and thermal conductivity, were identified. The impact of thermodynamic properties on the heat transfer, especially Nusselt number was also discussed. Stability of the molten salts with structural alloys and their compatibility with the structural alloys was studied. Nickel and alloys with dense Ni coatings are effectively inert to corrosion in fluorides but not so in chlorides. Of the chromium containing alloys, Hastelloy N appears to have the best corrosion resistance in fluorides, while Haynes 230 was most resistant in chloride. In general, alloys with increasing carbon and chromium content are increasingly subject to corrosion by the fluoride salts FLiBe and FLiNaK, due to attack and dissolution of the intergranular chromium carbide. Future research to obtain needed information was identified.},

@techreport{williams2006Cp,
	abstractnote = {The Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a novel reactor design that utilizes the graphite-matrix high-temperature fuel of helium-cooled reactors, but provides cooling with a high-temperature fluoride salt. For applications at temperatures greater than 900 C the AHTR is also referred to as a Liquid-Salt-Cooled Very High-Temperature Reactor (LS-VHTR). This report provides an assessment of candidate salts proposed as the primary coolant for the AHTR based upon a review of physical properties, nuclear properties, and chemical factors. The physical properties most relevant for coolant service were reviewed. Key chemical factors that influence material compatibility were also analyzed for the purpose of screening salt candidates. Some simple screening factors related to the nuclear properties of salts were also developed. The moderating ratio and neutron-absorption cross-section were compiled for each salt. The short-lived activation products, long-lived transmutation activity, and reactivity coefficients associated with various salt candidates were estimated using a computational model. Table A presents a summary of the properties of the candidate coolant salts. Certain factors in this table, such as melting point, vapor pressure, and nuclear properties, can be viewed as stand-alone parameters for screening candidates. Heat-transfer properties are considered as a group in Sect. 3 in order to evaluate the combined effects of various factors. In the course of this review, it became apparent that the state of the properties database was strong in some areas and weak in others. A qualitative map of the state of the database and predictive capabilities is given in Table B. It is apparent that the property of thermal conductivity has the greatest uncertainty and is the most difficult to measure. The database, with respect to heat capacity, can be improved with modern instruments and modest effort. In general, ''lighter'' (low-Z) salts tend to exhibit better heat transfer and nuclear performance metrics. Lighter salts also tend to have more favorable (larger) moderating ratios, and thus should have a more favorable coolant-voiding behavior in-core. Heavy (high-Z) salts tend to have lower heat capacities and thermal conductivities and more significant activation and transmutation products. However, all of the salts are relatively good heat-transfer agents. A detailed discussion of each property and the combination of properties that served as a heat-transfer metric is presented in the body of this report. In addition to neutronic metrics, such as moderating ratio and neutron absorption, the activation properties of the salts were investigated (Table C). Again, lighter salts tend to have more favorable activation properties compared to salts with high atomic-number constituents. A simple model for estimating the reactivity coefficients associated with a reduction of salt content in the core (voiding or thermal expansion) was also developed, and the primary parameters were investigated. It appears that reasonable design flexibility exists to select a safe combination of fuel-element design and salt coolant for most of the candidate salts. Materials compatibility is an overriding consideration for high-temperature reactors; therefore the question was posed whether any one of the candidate salts was inherently, or significantly, more corrosive than another. This is a very complex subject, and it was not possible to exclude any fluoride salts based on the corrosion database. The corrosion database clearly indicates superior container alloys, but the effect of salt identity is masked by many factors which are likely more important (impurities, redox condition) in the testing evidence than salt identity. Despite this uncertainty, some reasonable preferences can be recommended, and these are indicated in the conclusions. The reasoning to support these conclusions is established in the body of this report.},
