    abstract = "{To optimize the efficiency and safety of molten salt-based energy applications, accurate molten salt thermophysical property data are required. For molten fluorides, existing thermal conductivity results have large uncertainties and contradict the current theory by eliciting a positive temperature coefficient. Transient grating spectroscopy (TGS), a technique previously deemed reliable by the theoretical community, has been used to measure the thermal conductivity of fluorides (FLiNaK) for the first time. Results show a fairly flat but slightly increasing thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. The technique has been shown to not suffer from contributions from convection and radiation, an explanation used to discount the results of alternative experimental techniques. In addition to thermal conductivity, sound speed data as a function of temperature have also been obtained for the first time in FLiNaK. The use of accurate sound speed data in theoretical models of thermal conductivity provides better but not complete agreement with the results from TGS. The continued existence of a positive temperature coefficient highlights the need for new mechanistic proposals for why TGS, or current theoretical models, are unable to capture the correct temperature dependence for fluoride molten salt thermal conductivity.}",

abstract = {Molten salt mixtures are integral part of highly important technological applications such as nuclear reactors. However, due to inherent difficulties associated with experiment at high temperatures and the intrinsic complexity of liquid-phase multi-component systems, understanding their properties at a molecular level remains a challenge. Here, we report on an ab initio molecular dynamics investigation on structural, electronic, transport, and thermal properties of two common molten salt mixtures, (K, Li)Cl and (K,Na)Cl, at five different compositions and three temperatures. Most of the properties were found to depend on both composition and temperature. While properties, like atomic charges, show additive behaviors, other properties, such as electrical conductivity, show considerable deviations from additivity. We shall show that the mixing of the molten salt mixtures is mainly driven by entropy, and that the KCl and LiCl mix better than KCl and NaCl. Our computational results are in general consistent with available experimental data. Comparison with available theoretical data is also provided.}

abstract = {Abstract Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

abstract = {Molten salts have many applications in the nuclear and solar energy industries for thermal storage and heat transfer applications. However, there is a knowledge gap in molten salt thermophysical properties which hinders the technical readiness level of molten salt applications, especially in the nuclear industry. A common method of investigating new materials is through ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations which is an effective tool to investigate structural and thermophysical properties at realistic temperatures. NaCl-MgCl2 is an inexpensive salt that is a good candidate for use as a heat transfer medium in solar power applications or in the secondary loop of a nuclear reactor. In this article, the thermophysical properties of NaCl-MgCl2 are computed via AIMD calculations to supplement the limited experimental studies in the literature. A wide range of compositions and temperatures for the pseudo-binary NaCl-MgCl2 were used to calculate the density, heat capacity, compressibility, enthalpy of mixing, and volumetric thermal expansion coefficient. AIMD is shown to accurately model the densities of molten NaCl-MgCl2 as there is good agreement with the available literature. This work observed a transition to a monotonic increase of the density with respect to MgCl2 composition occurring above 1100 K. The heat capacity values increase uniformly with respect to concentration of MgCl2 at a rate of 2.85 J/mol-K per 10 mol\% of MgCl2. Select thermophysical properties are fit to a Redlich-Kister expansion for utilization in multiphysics simulations.}

abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are envisioned as a potential pathway to safer, more economical nuclear electricity generation and supply of industrial heat. MSRs under consideration today are either solid-fueled salt-cooled designs or liquid-salt-fueled designs with chloride or fluoride based salts. A significant knowledge gap exists in the data for the fundamental properties relevant to fuels and coolants for MSRs that needs to be addressed in order to expedite the technical readiness level of the MSR design concepts. With the rapid development and improvement of computational materials science, computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations are widely used as an effective and reliable tool to investigate the atomic interaction in materials. In this article, the density of the LiCl-KCl system was determined via AIMD calculations and verified using new experimental analyses. AIMD was further utilized to calculate the compressibility, heat capacity, enthalpy of mixing, and Gibbs free energy of mixing. This work spans a wider range of compositions and temperatures than have previously been explored computationally for this pseudo-binary system and provides the basis for further advanced thermophysical property evaluation utilizing AIMD methods.}

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.}

For all the systems the phase diagrams are presented with the emphasis on the melting behaviour and the vapour pressure.

abstractNote = {Heat transfer coefficients were determined for the eutectic mixture LiF- KF-NaF (Flinak) flowing in forced convection through circular tubes. Heat, electrically generated in the tube wall was transferred uniformly to the fluid during passage through small-diameter tubes of nickel, Inconel, and 316 stainless steel. The variables involved: Reynolds modulus (N/sub R//sub e/), 2300 to 9500; Prandtl modulus (N/sub P//sub r/, 1.6 to 4.0; average fluid temperatures, 980 to 1370 deg F; and heat flux, 9,000 to 192,000 Btu/hr-ft/sup 2/. Forced-convection heat transfer with Flinak can be represented by the general correlation for heat transfer with ordinary fluids (0.5 < N /sub P//sub r/< 100). The existence of an interfacial resistance in Flinak-Inconel systems was established and its composition determined. Preliminary measurements of thermal conductivity and thickness of film were made. The results verify the effect of the film on Flinak heat transfer in small-diameter Inconel tubes. Thermal entry lengths, determined from variations of local heat transfer coefficients in the entrance of the heated section, were correlated with the Peclet modulus. (auth)},

abstractNote = {The purpose of this report is to provide a review of thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of candidate molten salt coolants, which may be used as a primary coolant within a nuclear reactor or heat transport medium from the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) to a processing plant, for example, a hydrogen-production plant. Thermodynamic properties of four types of molten salts, including LiF-BeF2 (67 and 33 mol\%, respectively; also known as FLiBe), LiF-NaF-KF (46.5, 11.5, and 52 mol\%, also known as FLiNaK), and KCl-MgCl2 (67 and 33 mol\%), and sodium nitrate-sodium nitrite-potassium nitrate (NaNO3–NaNO2–KNO3, (7-49-44 or 7-40-53 mol\%) have been investigated. Limitations of existing correlations to predict density, viscosity, specific heat capacity, surface tension, and thermal conductivity, were identified. The impact of thermodynamic properties on the heat transfer, especially Nusselt number was also discussed. Stability of the molten salts with structural alloys and their compatibility with the structural alloys was studied. Nickel and alloys with dense Ni coatings are effectively inert to corrosion in fluorides but not so in chlorides. Of the chromium containing alloys, Hastelloy N appears to have the best corrosion resistance in fluorides, while Haynes 230 was most resistant in chloride. In general, alloys with increasing carbon and chromium content are increasingly subject to corrosion by the fluoride salts FLiBe and FLiNaK, due to attack and dissolution of the intergranular chromium carbide. Future research to obtain needed information was identified.},

author = {Williams, D. F.},
abstractNote = {This report provides an assessment of candidate salts proposed as the coolant for the loop that shuttles heat from the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) to the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) hydrogen-production plant. The physical properties most relevant for coolant service were reviewed, and key chemical factors that influence material compatibility were also analyzed for the purpose of screening candidate salts. A preliminary assessment of the cost of the raw materials required to produce the coolant is also presented. Salts that are suitable for use as the primary coolant in a high-temperature nuclear reactor were previously analyzed. Some of the fluoride salts identified in the previous study are also appropriate for consideration as the secondary coolant in a heat-transfer loop; therefore, results from the previous report are used in this document. However, alternative coolant salts (i.e., chlorides and fluoroborates) that were not considered in the previous report should be considered for service in the heat-transfer loop. These alternative coolants are considered in this report.},

@techreport{williams2006Cp,
title = {Assessment of Candidate Molten Salt Coolants for the Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR)},
author = {Williams, D F},
abstractNote = {The Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a novel reactor design that utilizes the graphite-matrix high-temperature fuel of helium-cooled reactors, but provides cooling with a high-temperature fluoride salt. For applications at temperatures greater than 900 C the AHTR is also referred to as a Liquid-Salt-Cooled Very High-Temperature Reactor (LS-VHTR). This report provides an assessment of candidate salts proposed as the primary coolant for the AHTR based upon a review of physical properties, nuclear properties, and chemical factors. The physical properties most relevant for coolant service were reviewed. Key chemical factors that influence material compatibility were also analyzed for the purpose of screening salt candidates. Some simple screening factors related to the nuclear properties of salts were also developed. The moderating ratio and neutron-absorption cross-section were compiled for each salt. The short-lived activation products, long-lived transmutation activity, and reactivity coefficients associated with various salt candidates were estimated using a computational model. Table A presents a summary of the properties of the candidate coolant salts. Certain factors in this table, such as melting point, vapor pressure, and nuclear properties, can be viewed as stand-alone parameters for screening candidates. Heat-transfer properties are considered as a group in Sect. 3 in order to evaluate the combined effects of various factors. In the course of this review, it became apparent that the state of the properties database was strong in some areas and weak in others. A qualitative map of the state of the database and predictive capabilities is given in Table B. It is apparent that the property of thermal conductivity has the greatest uncertainty and is the most difficult to measure. The database, with respect to heat capacity, can be improved with modern instruments and modest effort. In general, ''lighter'' (low-Z) salts tend to exhibit better heat transfer and nuclear performance metrics. Lighter salts also tend to have more favorable (larger) moderating ratios, and thus should have a more favorable coolant-voiding behavior in-core. Heavy (high-Z) salts tend to have lower heat capacities and thermal conductivities and more significant activation and transmutation products. However, all of the salts are relatively good heat-transfer agents. A detailed discussion of each property and the combination of properties that served as a heat-transfer metric is presented in the body of this report. In addition to neutronic metrics, such as moderating ratio and neutron absorption, the activation properties of the salts were investigated (Table C). Again, lighter salts tend to have more favorable activation properties compared to salts with high atomic-number constituents. A simple model for estimating the reactivity coefficients associated with a reduction of salt content in the core (voiding or thermal expansion) was also developed, and the primary parameters were investigated. It appears that reasonable design flexibility exists to select a safe combination of fuel-element design and salt coolant for most of the candidate salts. Materials compatibility is an overriding consideration for high-temperature reactors; therefore the question was posed whether any one of the candidate salts was inherently, or significantly, more corrosive than another. This is a very complex subject, and it was not possible to exclude any fluoride salts based on the corrosion database. The corrosion database clearly indicates superior container alloys, but the effect of salt identity is masked by many factors which are likely more important (impurities, redox condition) in the testing evidence than salt identity. Despite this uncertainty, some reasonable preferences can be recommended, and these are indicated in the conclusions. The reasoning to support these conclusions is established in the body of this report.},
