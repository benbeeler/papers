Determination of thermal expansion, defect formation energy, and defect-induced strain of -U via ab initio molecular dynamics Benjamin Beeler 1;2;∗ , Khadija Mahbuba 1 , Yuhao Wang 3 , and Andrea Jokisaari 1;2 1North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27607 2Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Falls, ID 83415 3University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 Correspondence*: 2500 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC, 27607 bwbeeler@ncsu.edu 2 ABSTRACT 3 Uranium (U) is often alloyed with molybdenum (Mo) or zirconium (Zr) in order to stabilize its high4 temperature body-centered cubic phase for use in nuclear reactors. However, in all metallic fuel 5 forms, the α phase of U remains in some fraction. This phase decomposition due to temperature 6 or compositional variance can play an outsized role on fuel performance and microstructural 7 evolution. Relatively little is known about fundamental point defect properties in -U at non-zero 8 temperatures, from either computational or experimental studies. This work performs the first 9 thorough evaluation of the α phase of U via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). A number of 10 thermophysical properties are calculated as a function of temperature, including equilibrium lattice 11 parameters, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. These results indicate a two-region behavior, 12 with the transition at 400 K. The thermal expansion/contraction in the a/b direction occurs rapidly 13 from 100 K up to 400 K, after which a more linear and gradual change in the lattice constant 14 takes place. The volumetric expansion matches experiments quantitatively, but the individual 15 lattice constant expansion only matches experiments qualitatively. Point defect formation energies 16 and induced lattice strains are also determined as a function of temperature, providing insight 17 on defect populations and the fundamentals of irradiation growth in -U. Interstitials induce 18 significantly more strain than vacancies, and the nature of that strain is highly dependent on the 19 individual lattice directions. The direction of point defect induced lattice strain is contrary to the 20 irradiation growth behavior of -U. This work shows that isolated point defects cannot be the 21 primary driving force responsible for the significant irradiation induced growth of -U observed 22 experimentally. 23 Keywords: alpha uranium, ab initio molecular dynamics, point defects, lattice strain, fuel swelling 1 INTRODUCTION 24 Uranium (U) is an actinide element exhibiting delocalized f-electrons that exists in three solid phases: α 25 (face-centered orthorhombic), β (tetragonal with a 30 atom unit cell) and γ (body-centered cubic) Yoo et al. 26 (1998). Below 935 K, U exists in the α phase S¨oderlind (1998). Although uranium is alloyed with Mo or 27 Zr in order to stabilize the preferred body-centered cubic phase at lower temperatures, most notably for Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 28 nuclear fuel applications, the α phase persists either in decomposed phase regions (as in the case of U-Mo 29 fuel), or in the low temperature periphery of the fuel slug (as in the case of U-Zr type fuel). Because of its unique crystal structure, -U exhibits anisotropic material properties, for example, thermal expansion 31 Lloyd and Barrett (1966) and elastic constants Fisher and McSkimin (1958). One relevant behavior is 32 the anisotropic irradiation growth of -U Leggett et al. (1963), which can lead to the tearing along grain 33 boundaries and the formation of crystallographically aligned pores. These porosities are believed to form 34 due to the interaction of lattice defects and stresses induced by irradiation and a temperature gradient, and result in significant volume changes of -U Leggett et al. (1963); Paine and Kittel (1958). A full 36 understanding of the relationship between point defects, lattice strains, and the generation of pores, has not 37 been established either experimentally or via computational methods. However, a number of computational 38 studies have been performed into fundamental properties of uranium Jokisaari (2020). 39 Density functional theory (DFT) is an essential part of computational materials science, addressing a variety of problems in materials design and processing on a fundamental level. Several examinations of 41 U via DFT have been performed on its orthorhombic and body-centered cubic (bcc) structures. Taylor 42 Taylor (2008) used a projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potential to calculate the lattice constants 43 of -U and -U along with the bulk modulus of both phases and the surface energy of a single surface 44 in -U. Xiang, et al. Xiang et al. (2008) also utilized a PAW pseudo-potential to perform an analysis of lattice constants in the α and γ phases, as well as an analysis of defects in -U. Beeler, et al. calculated 46 the lattice constants and elastic constants of , β and -U Beeler et al. (2013), in addition to the point 47 defect properties in both α and -U Beeler et al. (2010). Huang and Wirth Huang and Wirth (2011, 2012) 48 calculated intrinsic and extrinsic point defect formation energies and migration barriers in -U. These DFT 49 investigations showed a general, if imperfect, agreement with the experimental bulk moduli, lattice and elastic constants, and vacancy formation energy Yoo et al. (1998); Barrett et al. (1963); Matter et al. (1980). 51 Key areas lacking from the DFT-based literature on -U include an analysis of temperature-dependent bulk 52 properties, including thermal expansion and heat capacity, and temperature-dependent defect properties. 53 Extrapolation of 0 K properties to compare to elevated temperature experiments can be ill-advised, 54 particularly for complex crystal structures or for point defects. However, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) allows for quantum mechanical-based calculations to be performed at non-zero temperatures. 56 AIMD has been utilized to study a variety of systems including liquid phase diffusion in Al-Si Manga 57 and Poirier (2018), adsorption energy of Fe on TiN surfaces Wang et al. (2010), NaCl dissolution in water 58 Timko et al. (2010) and finite temperature phonon dispersion curves in bcc Zr and bcc Li Hellman et al. 59 (2011). Hood, et al. Hood et al. (2008) have previously utilized AIMD to study the equation of state of U and the variation in density of states for the liquid phase of U at two unique temperatures. Hood, 61 et al. utilized a unique pseudo-potential that was presented in that same manuscript Hood et al. (2008). 62 Soderlind, et al. S¨oderlind et al. (2012) utilized self-consistent ab initio lattice dynamics (SCAILD) to 63 study the high temperature stabilization of the -U phase by calculating phonon modes at 1100 K. There 64 have been several investigations of the free energy via the temperature dependent effective potential (TDEP) technique Hellman et al. (2013); Ladygin et al. (2020); Kruglov et al. (2019); Bouchet and Bottin (2017); 66 Castellano et al. (2020), and one recent AIMD investigation into the defect formation energies in -U at 67 high temperatures Beeler et al. (2020). Despite numerous investigated into metallic uranium, AIMD has 68 not been deployed to study temperature dependent properties of -U, such as thermal expansion or defect 69 formation energies. In this work, AIMD simulations are performed to calculate the equilibrium volume of -U as a function of 71 temperature. Utilizing these equilibrium volumes, the three lattice constants of -U are determined, yielding This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 72 anisotropic thermal expansion calculations. Additionally, point defect formation energies for interstitials 73 and vacancies are calculated as a function of temperature. The lattice strain from the introduction of these 74 point defects is calculated, providing insight into the fundamental stages of irradiation growth. This is the first AIMD investigation of point defects in -U. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 76 Systems are investigated using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) Kresse and Hafner (1993, 77 1994); Kresse and F¨ ochl (1994); urthmuller (1996a,b). The projector augmented wave (PAW) method Bl¨ 78 Kresse and Joubert (1999) is utilized within the density functional theory Hohenberg and Kohn (1964); 79 Kohn and Sham (1965) framework. Calculations are performed using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) Perdew et al. (1996, 1997) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional implementation 81 for the description of the exchange-correlation. A uranium PAW pseudo-potential with the 6s26p65f36d17s2 82 valence electronic configuration and a core represented by [Xe, 5d, 4f] is utilized. Methfessel and Paxton’s 83 smearing method Methfessel and Paxton (1989) of the first order is used with a width of 0.1 eV to 84 determine the partial occupancies for each wave-function. A Monkhorst-Pack Monkhorst and Pack (1976) 1x1x1 k-point mesh was utilized for Brillouin zone sampling. Uranium is assumed to be non-magnetic, in 86 accordance with both experiments Lide (2000) and previous simulations Beeler et al. (2013), and as such 87 calculations are non-spin-polarized. The Hubbard U term is not applied to the f electrons, in accordance 88 with previous computational studies that utilized DFT on -U Huang and Wirth (2011, 2012); Taylor 89 (2008); Beeler et al. (2013). The precision is set to normal and the energy cutoff is increased to 300 eV. The electronic self-consistent loop exit criterion is set to 10􀀀4 and the precision for projectors in real 91 space is increased to -10􀀀4 . A 180 atom supercell (5x3x3 unit cells) is utilized for all simulations. Such 92 a supercell is sufficiently large to preclude defect-defect interactions. Dynamics were carried out in the 93 NpT ensemble with Parinello-Rahman dynamics and a Langevin thermostat to control temperature. The 94 temperature range investigated is from 100 K to 800 K, in increments of 100 K, to span nearly the entire range of stability of the α phase of U. The Langevin friction coefficient for both the atomic and lattice 96 degrees-of-freedom was set to 5 ps􀀀1, with a fictitious mass for the lattice degrees of freedom of 500 amu. 97 The timestep is set to 2.0 fs, and the initial structures are equilibrated at the target temperature for 8 ps. The 98 trajectories of the total supercell energy, pressure, and individual lattice vectors are analyzed as a function 99 of timestep to ensure that an equilibrated state has been reached and each of these quantities are oscillating around a given value, with the pressure oscillating around zero. Subsequently, the simulations are further 101 equilibrated for 2000 timesteps (4 ps) for the determination of equilibrium properties. In order to obtain 102 average properties over the ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, the energies and lattice constants for 103 the final 1500 timesteps (3 ps) are extracted and averaged. In order to ensure statistical significance of the 104 results, ten unique simulations are performed for each individual simulation setup. An example trajectory of the individual supercell lattice constants over time at 300 K is shown in Fig. 1. The standard deviation 106 in the a, b, and c equilibrium lattice constants from this single simulation are 0.01 ° °A, 0.02 A and 0.01 107 °A, respectively. It should be emphasized that this was a single simulation, and ten such simulations were 108 performed to obtain the averaged equilibrium structures and energies. Error bars are excluded from figures 109 in the results that pertain to lattice constants, due to the small deviations observed in the dataset. The thermal expansion is calculated both for individual lattice constants, and as a volume averaged value, 111 via equation 1: L − L0α = (1)L0 Frontiers 3 Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U Figure 1. The supercell lattice dimensions as a function of time for -U. Each dimension is averaged over the final 3 ps to obtain the average lattice constant in the simulation. 112 where α is the thermal expansion, and L is the length of the individual lattice constant or averaged lattice 113 constant at a given temperature, and L0 is the reference length at a given temperature. The formation energy 114 of point defects is calculated via equation 2: n ± 1 Ef = E ∗ 􀀀× E0 (2) n 115 where E∗ is the energy of a system with a defect (with n 1 atoms), n is the number of atoms in the 116 defect-free system and E0 is the energy of a defect-free system with n atoms. Equation 2 utilizes (n + 1) for 117 interstitials and (n -1) for vacancies. The molar heat capacity is determined from equation 3:  H CP = (3)T P 118 where H is the enthalpy (potential plus kinetic energy), T is the temperature, and it is emphasized that this 119 is determined for a constant pressure, which in these simulations is zero pressure. The total heat capacity is 120 a sum of the lattice (Eq. 3) and the electronic components of the heat capacity. The electronic heat capacity 121 coefficient (e, where the electronic heat capacity is eT) has been experimentally reported to be 10.12 122 mJ/mol-K2 Marchidan and Ciopec (1976); Schachinger and Lamprecht (1989) , and this value is utilized 123 here to determine the total heat capacity as a function of temperature. 3 RESULTS 124 3.1 Equilibrium properties of -U 125 The equilibrium lattice constants at 300 K were calculated to be: a = 2.78 A,° b = 5.91 A,° and c = 4.93 A.° 126 These results compare very favorably to the experimental literature (a = 2.85A,° b = 5.87 °A, and c = 4.96 ° 127 ALawson et al. (1988)), with the largest deviation observed for the a lattice constant at a magnitude of This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U approximately 2.5%. Some deviation is not unexpected, as it has been shown that DFT calculations do not always exactly match the experimental findings, particularly for the lattice constant. However, these results are in accordance with previously computational investigations of -U performed at 0 K, when thermal expansion is taken into account Huang and Wirth (2011); Beeler et al. (2013). The complete data for equilibrium lattice constants as calculated in this work is included in Table A1. The normalized lattice constants as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 2. Each lattice constant is normalized to its determined value at 100 K, which is the lowest temperature analyzed. Thermal expansion occurs in both the a and c directions, while thermal contraction occurs in the b direction, as has been previously experimentally observed Touloukian et al. (1975). The recommended directional linear thermal expansion curves from Touloukian et al. (1975) are included as a comparison in Fig. 3. Touloukian summarized 48 individual experiments on both single and polycrystalline samples and provided a recommended tabular fit for each a, b, c, and volumetric thermal expansion. These experiments did not all necessarily quantify their uncertainty, however, Touloukian stated that the recommended values are considered accurate to within +/-5%. The data in Fig. 3 utilizes 300 K as the reference point for both the AIMD data and the experimental data, and as such, the change in length at 300 K is zero. It can be observed that the AIMD predicted thermal expansion in the a direction is significantly greater than that determined from experiment. Similarly, the amount of contraction in the b direction predicted from AIMD is significantly greater than that observed in experiments. However, the c direction exactly matches the linear thermal expansion determined from experiments. Qualitatively, all of the behaviors are identical, with the a and b directions expressing a more extreme expansion/contraction behavior. The source of the deviations from experiment are currently unknown. A comparison of the elastic constants calculated at 0 K Beeler et al. (2013)compared to the experimentally determined elastic constants Fisher and McSkimin (1958) yielded no obvious discrepancies that would point to the specific observed trends in the thermal expansion as a function of temperature. The DFT-predicted elastic constants generally overestimate the experimental elastic constants, including all of C11,C22,C33, and the bulk modulus, and do not imply the existence of exaggerated swelling/contraction in the a/b directions. Frontiers Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U Figure 2. The normalized lattice constants as a function of temperature for -U.

Interestingly, the data from AIMD nearly exactly 156 matches the experimental results for volumetric-averaged thermal expansion, with only slight deviations 157 presenting above 600 K. Thus, despite the differences in the individual components of thermal expansion This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 158 in -U, which are somewhat substantial, the cumulative effect on total volume expansion reproduces the 159 experimental observations. Figure 4. Volume-averaged linear thermal expansion in -U. Thermal expansion is taken with respect to 300 K and compared to experimental results Touloukian et al. (1975). 160 The total constant pressure heat capacity is determined from a summation of equation 3 and the electronic 161 heat capacity contribution as determined by experiments, and is plotted in Fig. 5. The complete heat 162 capacity data as calculated in this work is included in Table A2. Data points are shown at intermediate 163 temperatures, as the formalism in equation 3 assumes effectively a constant value of Cp over the temperature 164 range. Thus, utilizing data points at 100 K and 200 K, for example, yields a value of Cp at 150 K in this 165 work. Experimental data is only reported for room temperature and upwards, and the agreement with the 166 AIMD is generally excellent. The maximum deviation is observed at 750 K, where the AIMD results 167 under-predict the magnitude of Cp by approximately 11%. At lower temperatures, the deviation can be 168 less than 5%. Thus, while the magnitude of the heat capacity is generally the same, it appears that the 169 experimentally observed heat capacity is more sensitive to temperature, showing a total change from 170 250-750 K of 17 J/mol-K, while AIMD only predicts at increase of 11 J/mol-K over this temperature range. Frontiers Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U Figure 5. The constant pressure heat capacity of -U from 100 K to 800 K. Results from this work are compared to experimental results from Konings Konings and Benes (2010). Error bars indicate twice the standard error of the AIMD dataset. 171 3.2 Point defects in -U 172 The point defect formation energy of interstitials and vacancies in -U is shown in Fig. 6 and included in 173 Table A3. The defect formation energy for both types of defects tends to slightly decrease with increasing 174 temperature until approximately 400 K. Above 400 K, an increase in the defect formation energy with 175 increasing temperature is observed. The relative magnitudes of the defect formation energies with respect to 176 one another are near constant across the entire temperature range investigated, with the average interstitial 177 formation energy (3.4 eV) about 2.3 times the average vacancy formation energy (1.46 eV). Error bars 178 shown in Fig. 6 are twice the standard error, where the standard error for formation energies is defined as bulk defSE2 = √ + √ (4)NN 179 where bulk=def is the standard deviation of the dataset utilized for determining the average energies of 180 either the defect-free or the defected system, and N is the sample size, which is ten simulations for both the 181 defected and defect-free simulations. The standard error in the data set tends to increase with increasing 182 temperature, as would be expected. The results from the lower temperature regime can be compared to 183 previous results from 0 K DFT calculations. At 100 K, the interstitial formation energy is found to be 3.81 184 eV, and the vacancy formation energy is found to be 1.69 eV. These results compare favorably to previous 185 0 K DFT results Huang and Wirth (2011), which showed a vacancy formation energy of 1.69 eV (an exact 186 match), and interstitial formation energy of 4.42 eV. That the interstitial formation energy from this work is 187 lower is not unsurprising. While DFT can access any prescribed positional state, the identification of the 188 lowest energy defect location can often be complex, and is complicated by the possibility of local minima. 189 By including temperature effects, atomic vibrations can more readily overcome any potential local minima 190 that exist within the energy surface, theoretically finding the lowest possible energy state, and thus the 191 equilibrium defect location at that given temperature. This data can be utilized to conduct higher length This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 192 scale simulations which attempt to describe defect formation and mobility and those which include an 193 estimation of the equilibrium concentrations of defects. Figure 6. The formation energy of an interstitial and a vacancy in -U as a function of temperature. The defect formation energies from previous DFT work are included for comparison Huang and Wirth (2011). 194 The introduction of a defect and relaxation in an NpT ensemble allows for the analysis of volume changes 195 due to individual point defects. These volume changes are reported as a function of temperature in Fig. 7, 196 with error bars included as twice the standard deviation of the dataset. The defect-induced strains are also 197 included in Table A4. For interstitials, there clearly exist two distinct regimes in the defect-induced strain 198 environment, with 400 K serving as the demarcation temperature. Below 400 K, strain is relatively large 199 and positive (lattice expansion) in the a direction, and relatively large and negative (lattice compression) 200 for the b direction. The magnitudes of those strains decrease with increasing temperature up to 400 K, 201 above which they maintain a relatively fixed value, with some statistical fluctuation. It is unknown whether 202 the deviation at 600 K is due to some distinct behavioral changes, or is simply the result of thermal noise. 203 However, data points at 600 K generally remain within the general trend of the dataset. The c lattice 204 constant exhibits very slight positive strain across the entire temperature range, with no obvious changes 205 in behavior. For vacancies, the general magnitude of the strain is significantly less than that observed 206 for interstitials, with the maximum strain of -0.5% observed at 800 K for the b lattice constant. While 207 it is more difficult to discern trends in the vacancy strain as a function of temperature, several pieces of 208 information can be readily extracted. The c lattice constant displays no observed strain from vacancies 209 at any temperature. For the a and b lattice constants, opposite trends present themselves above 400 K, 210 in that the a lattice constant strain increases with increasing temperature and the b lattice constant strain 211 decreases with increasing temperature. In a general sense, the strain behavior of defects is as expected, 212 in that interstitials yield a lattice expansion, while vacancies produce lattice contraction. However, the Frontiers Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 213 manner in which those volumetric averages are produced is quite complex, and is significantly temperature 214 dependent. Figure 7. The lattice strain induced from an interstitial or vacancy in -U as a function of temperature, taken with respect to the equilibrium volume at that given temperature. Error bars indicate twice the standard deviation of the dataset. 4 DISCUSSION 215 This work indicates a number of lattice and volume effects that are strongly dependent upon the temperature 216 of the system. Excepting the heat capacity, all of these calculated properties seem to indicate two regions 217 of behavior, one below 400 K and one above 400 K. Also, it should be re-emphasized that the heat capacity 218 utilized an experimental data point for the determination of the electronic heat capacity. Thus, from the 219 purely computationally obtained data, there are differences in lattice constant, defect-induced lattice strain, 220 and defect formation energy, in these two temperature regimes. To briefly summarize, thermal expansion 221 expansion/contraction in the a/b direction occurs rapidly from 100 K up to 400 K, after which a more linear 222 and gradual change in the lattice constant takes place. Defect formation energies decrease in magnitude up 223 to 400 K, above which they tend to slightly increase. Defect lattice strains for interstitials decrease/increase 224 in the a/b direction up to 400 K, above which they maintain essentially the same magnitude. A similar 225 trend in defect lattice strains for vacancies is present, but the magnitude is significantly less and potentially 226 swamped by thermal fluctuations, and thus the statistical certainty of the finding is reduced. 227 In an attempt to identify underlying changes in the atomic and electronic structure as a function of 228 temperature, two additional analyses were performed. The first was a coordination analysis, in which the 229 radial distribution function (rdf) was constructed for a snapshot of the equilibrated -U structure at 100 K, 230 400 K, and 800 K. If a modification in the bond lengths is occurring that can yield differences in structure, 231 such a modification would present itself as peak shifts in the rdf. This coordination analysis is presented in 232 Fig. 8, but yielded no discernible trends, and the general bond length and peak broadening confirms what is 233 observed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 outlining thermal expansion. Specifically, there is general peak broadening This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 234 with temperature, and the second nearest neighbor peak (in the b direction) slightly shifts towards a smaller 235 distance. The second analysis involved the electronic density of states (DOS). If the character of valence 236 electrons participating in the bonding are changing as a function of temperature, the electronic DOS would 237 identify such changes, and the electronic DOS is known to slightly change as a function of the phase 238 of uranium Beeler et al. (2013). The electronic DOS was calculated, and only minimal variation in the 239 electronic structure was observed as a function of temperature. There was no indication that two regions of 240 electronic structure behavior exist for the α phase. Due to the lack of identifiable structure variation as a 241 function of temperature, likely due to statistical noise in the sampling. These results are not displayed here, 242 as the DOS can be obtained from the literature Beeler et al. (2013); Hood et al. (2008). The underlying 243 cause of the apparent two-region behavior is unclear, and warrants further computational investigation, in 244 addition to experimental studies on high-purity uranium to either confirm or refute the findings in this work. 245 It should be emphasized that these results are statistically significant, but are still susceptible to inherent 246 errors in the modeling methodology, such as the inability for DFT to predict the lattice and elastic constants 247 of -U with sufficient accuracy at 0 K. Figure 8. The radial distribution function in -U at 100 K, 400 K, and 800 K. 248 This work has identified that individual point defect can produce somewhat significant lattice strain, but 249 it is unknown if such point defects could be responsible for experimentally observed macroscopic shape 250 change. Comparison of the calculated direction of the defect-induced strains to the experimental literature 251 on irradiation growth provides contradictory information. Paine and Kittel Paine and Kittel (1958) and 252 Loomis and Gerber Loomis and Gerber (1968) both investigated dimensional change of single crystal 253 uranium under irradiation. Their findings were in general agreement with one another, and showed a 254 contraction of the bulk crystal in the a direction, an expansion in the b direction, and no change in the c Frontiers 11 Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 255 direction. While the AIMD results of point defect-induced strains presented here agree with the lack of 256 dimensional change in the c direction, exactly the opposite behavior is observed in Fig. 7 for the a and b 257 directions. This work showed that interstitials are the dominant strain inducers, producing expansion in the 258 a direction and contraction in the b direction. Due to the relatively large induced strains from interstitials, 259 it is expected that these types of point defects would display strongly anisotropic diffusion. Given that 260 isolated point defects lead to the opposite trends from those observed experimentally, it is possible that 261 defect clusters or defect loops display different strain behaviors than individual point defects, and are the 262 features responsible for irradiation growth in -U. Such research is beyond the scope of AIMD, which is 263 currently sufficiently computationally expensive to exclude the possibility of analysis of extended defects. 264 Thus, classical molecular dynamics simulations can be performed, and validated against the work presented 265 here. Ideally, in addition to further computational studies, the experimental results from over sixty years 266 ago should be reproduced and modern characterization methods applied to extract fundamental defect 267 populations, densities, and orientations. 5 CONCLUSIONS 268 In this study, AIMD simulations were performed to calculate temperature-dependent properties of the 269 α phase of U from 100 K to 800 K. The thermal expansion of each individual lattice constant was 270 analyzed and compared to the experimental literature. Although the general direction of thermal expansion 271 corresponded to the experimental findings (positive in a and c, negative in b), the magnitudes of coefficient 272 of thermal expansion for the a and b directions was greater than that observed experimentally. However, the 273 volumetric expansion corresponded nearly exactly to the experimental findings in the literature. The heat 274 capacity was calculated as a function of temperature and showed a general agreement with experimental 275 results, although the computationally determined heat capacity was slightly less sensitive to temperature. 276 Variation in point defect formation energies was determined, with an average interstitial formation energy 277 of 3.40 eV, and an average vacancy formation energy of 1.46 eV, over the entire temperature range. Lattice 278 strains resulting from point defects were determined, showing that interstitials induce significantly more 279 strain than vacancies, and the nature of that strain is highly dependent on the individual lattice directions, 280 where the a direction expands and the b contracts due to the introduction of an interstitial. Finally, all of 281 these results seem to indicate a two-region behavior, with the transition at 400 K. The thermal expansion 282 expansion/contraction in the a/b direction occurs rapidly from 100 K up to 400 K, after which a more linear 283 and gradual change in the lattice constant takes place. Defect formation energies decrease in magnitude up 284 to 400 K, above which they tend to slightly increase. Defect lattice strains for interstitials decrease/increase 285 in the a/b direction up to 400 K, above which they maintain essentially the same magnitude. Coordination 286 and electronic structure investigations provided no insight into the possible cause of this potential transition 287 in behavior. 288 This work has shown that isolated point defects cannot be the primary driving force responsible for the 289 significant irradiation induced growth of -U observed experimentally. This work can be utilized as the 290 basis for mesoscale simulations that take into account defect populations, defect diffusion, and defect strain 291 behaviors. It is emphasized that additional computational work utilizing classical molecular dynamics 292 on extended defects should be performed, in addition to experimental irradiation and characterization, to 293 further elucidate the underlying phenomena governing the interactions of point defects with the -U crystal 294 structure. This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article Beeler et al. AIMD calculation of temperature-dependent properties of -U 295 5.0.1 Permission to Reuse and Copyright 296 Figures, tables, and images will be published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence and 297 permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including re298 published/adapted/modified/partial figures and images from the internet).
