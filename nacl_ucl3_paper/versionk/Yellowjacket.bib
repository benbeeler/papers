@article{Li2020,
	abstract = {Molten chlorides are a good choice for fast-spectrum molten salt reactors, but many of their thermophysical and transport properties are not available. In this work we use classical molecular dynamics simulations based on the polarizable-ion model to investigate the structural and transport properties of NaCl-UCl3 at various U3+ mole fractions. Molar volume, coordination structure and number, network structure, heat capacity, diffusivity, and ion conductivity have been simulated. We find strong variation of the second coordination shells (U-U and Cl-Cl) with U3+ mole fraction. This is consistent with the increasing network formation or oligomerization of UCl63− and UCl74− units via shared Cl− ions. The movement of Cl− is strongly coupled with U3+ as the U-Cl network structures become dominant in the mixture when the mole fraction of UCl3 is >0.25. Evaluation of a heat-transfer figure-of-merit suggests that 0.20 to 0.30 is an optimal mole fraction of UCl3 to achieve both lower operating temperatures and better heat transfer.},

@article{Grimme,
	abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ``zero-damping'' formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The densities of the molten salt mixtures are optimized by FPMD simulations in NVT ensemble, and the local coordination structures are evaluated in terms of radial distribution functions and partial static structure factors. Both self-diffusion coefficients and ion conductivities are evaluated from the mean square displacements using Einstein relation for diffusion coefficients. It is conformed that the FPMD simulations give satisfactory structural and transport characteristics compared with experimental observations. Therefore, the predictability of FPMD simulations for structural and transport characteristics of molten salt mixtures is confirmed, and the FPMD simulations can be useful measurement in the establishment of database of actinide behavior in molten salt mixtures essential for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuels.},

@article{BENGTSON2014,
	abstract = {Properties of molten salts are of interest for a wide-range of applications, including nuclear waste partitioning, heat transfer fluids, and synthesis methods. While there has been extensive work showing the value of molecular modeling with interatomic potentials to predict molten salt properties there have been very limited studies of molten salts from a fully first-principles approach. In order to establish optimal approaches and their strengths and limitations in first-principles molten salt modeling, this work provides extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the LiCl--KCl molten salt system that are validated against existing literature. The basic thermokinetic properties of volume, thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and diffusivity, are calculated for LiCl, KCl and the eutectic LiCl--KCl liquids at multiple temperatures. Convergence testing reveals 216-atom unit cells and simulation times of 6--12ps are sufficient to provide results with acceptable uncertainties and agreement with experimental data. The results provide a framework of first principles molecular dynamics simulations in the LiCl--KCl molten salt system that can be extended in future research to predict less well-established properties, e.g., the behavior of solutes.},

A further improvement is to consider electronic correlation effects due to tightly bound and localized d-states on the transition metal atoms. With the DFT + U method used in this work, these correlation effects are taken in account and yield improved predictions for volume, magnetic moment, exchange splitting and bandgap. For MnS the semiconducting gap is correctly predicted, and for MnS2 the high-spin AFM type-III state can be stabilized over the low-spin state. For FeS even weak correlation effects lead to better predictions for the semiconducting gap, volume and magnetic moment.},
