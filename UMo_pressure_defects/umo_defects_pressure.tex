\section{Introduction}

Background on UMo fuel

Pressure state on UMo

Atomistic Calculations on UMo summary

What we will do

\section{Computational Details}
Molecular dynamics simulations are performed utilizing the LAMMPS \cite{plimpton1995} software package and the U-Mo angular dependent potential (ADP) \cite{smirnovaADP}. 





Relaxation is performed in an NPT-ensemble, relaxing each x, y, and z component individually, with a damping parameter of 0.1. A Nose-Hoover thermostat is utilized with the damping parameter set to 0.1 ps. Systems are investigated over a range of temperatures, from 600 K up to 1200 K. This temperature range was chosen due to the inherent properties of the potential, in that below 600 K $\gamma$U becomes mechanically unstable and above 1200 K the crystal structure is approaching the melting point. 

Systems are relaxed for 100 ps, with energies averaged over the final 50 ps. 



\section{Results}

Completed pressure-dependent defect formation energy calculations in UMo as a function of composition and temperature. Results at 1200 K are below, and show that the ressure does not dramatically affect trends in formation energy vs composition. The interstitial formation energy is more sensitive to pressure with >50\% Mo, and the vacancy formation energy is more sensitive to pressure with < 50\% Mo. The compositionally averaged behaviors show that 1 Gpa of pressure leads to approximately a 10\% increase/decrease in formation energy for interstitials and 1 Gpa of pressure leads to approximately a 2\% increase/decrease in formation energy for vacancies. The results are almost identical at 800 K, but less pressure-sensitive. Data is being pursued at 600 K for formation energies. Finally, diffusion coefficients for interstitials and vacancies as a function of pressure are being determined
