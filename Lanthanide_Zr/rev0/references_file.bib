	abstract = {The Advanced Fuels Campaign Fission Accelerated Steady-state Test (FAST) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) completed its first irradiation cycle within the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). The test focused on the irradiation of alloy fuel forms for use in sodium fast reactors. Tests included the use of fuel additives (Sn, Sb, and Pd) for reducing the gettering of lanthanide fission products, zirconium liners to mitigate fuel-cladding chemical interaction, and annular fuel geometry for sodium-free fuel designs. The first cycle of FAST testing was completed and a series of rodlets were removed for the initial post irradiation examination (PIE) of FAST rodlets. The rodlet irradiation conditions was evaluated using Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) for as-run power history and COMSOL for temperature analysis. These rodlets include a set of low burnups ({\textasciitilde}2.5 \% heavy metal [\%FIMA]) control rodlets and a helium bonded annular rodlet (4.7 \%FIMA). Initial non-destructive PIE has been completed and includes, visual inspection, neutron radiography and gamma scanning of the FAST rodlets. Radiography confirmed the integrity of the experiments as well as showing the complete filling of the annulus in the annular fuel at a modest burnup (4.7 \%FIMA) and potential slumping of the cooler rodlets at lower burnup. Precision gamma scanning indicated mostly usual fission product behavior with the exception of the ceasium in the He-bonded annular fuel. Future destructive PIE will be necessary in order to fully understand the effects of accelerated irradiation on U-Zr metallic fuel behavior.},

The sample studied had a local burnup of 5.7 atom percent and a local inner cladding temperature of 615 °C. This examination by electron microscopy has concentrated on producing data relevant to facilitating a better understanding of Zr redistribution in irradiated U-10Zr fuel and on a better understanding of the complex microstructure present in fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) layers. The presented zirconium redistribution data supplements the existing literature by providing a data set at these particular local conditions. In addition to FCCI layers that are readily visible in optical microscopy, this examination has revealed lanthanide degradation of the cladding by what appears to be a grain boundary facilitated pathway. Precipitates of fission produced Pd-lanthanide compounds were observed in the fuel. Precipitated regions with elevated Mo and elevated W content were also observed in the HT-9 cladding of this sample.},

	abstract = {Argonne National Laboratory is developing an electrometallurgical treatment for spent nuclear fuels. The initial demonstration of this process is being conducted on U-Zr and U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel elements irradiated in the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). The electrometallurgical treatment process extracts usable uranium from irradiated fuel elements and places residual fission products, actinides, process Zr, and cladding hulls (small segments of tubing) into two waste forms--a ceramic and a metal alloy. The metal waste form will contain the cladding hulls, Zr, and noble metal fission products, and it will be disposed of in a geologic repository. As a result, the expected composition of the waste form will need to be well understood. This report deals with the condition of the cladding, which will make up a large fraction of the metal waste form, after irradiation in EBR-II and before insertion into the electrorefiner. Specifically, it looks at layers that can be found on the inner surface of the cladding due to in-reactor interactions between the alloy fuel and the stainless steel cladding that occurs after the fuel has swelled and contacted the cladding. Many detailed examinations of fuel elements irradiated in EBR-II have been completed and are discussed in the context of interaction layer formation in irradiated cladding. The composition and thickness of the developed interaction layers are identified, along with the irradiation conditions, cladding type, and axial location on fuel elements where the thickest interaction layers can be expected to develop. It has been found that the largest interaction zones are observed at combined high power and high temperature regions of fuel elements and for fuel elements with U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel and D9 stainless steel cladding. The most prevalent, non-cladding constituent observed in the developed interaction layers are the lanthanide fission products.},

Cr, Fe, and Ni atoms attract interstitially dissolved H atoms whereas interstitial oxygen atoms show no pronounced interaction with H atoms. The alloying elements destabilize the hydride phases in the order Sn{\textgreater}Fe{\textgreater}Cr{\textgreater}Ni{\textgreater}Nb. Hence, substitutional Sn (if atomically dispersed), Cr and Fe atoms are likely to delay hydride precipitation, effectively increasing the hydrogen solubility. Nb and Sn influence the mobility of Zr self-interstitial atoms (SIA’s), which diffuse rapidly and preferentially parallel to the basal planes forming interstitial dislocations loops perpendicular to the basal planes (a-loops). Nb suppresses this diffusion of SIA’s, thereby reducing the rate of formation of interstitial a-loops. Sn atoms, if present on substitutional sites, have a similar, but smaller effect. If SIA’s approach substitutional Fe, Cr, and Ni atoms, the simulations indicate a spontaneous swap promoting the smaller transition metal atoms into interstitial atoms, which diffuse very rapidly with a preference in the c-direction, thereby facilitating their segregation to energetically more favorable sites such as vacancies, vacancy c-loops, grain boundaries, surfaces, and intermetallic precipitates.},

Differential scanning calorimetry data clearly showed δ⇌γ transformations in alloys with {\textless}10 wt\% Zr while XRD data did not contain any peaks which uniquely identify it's presence. Since δ phase forms via ω transformation, a comparison of the theoretical diffraction patterns for ω and δ revealed that the intensities of the peaks which uniquely identify the existence of δ when α-U is present, were either very weak, or were zero in ω, suggesting that the ambiguity can be explained if the phase present in these alloys is ω as opposed to δ. Our data are consistent with the presence of δ and ω in as-cast and quenched U–50Zr alloy, respectively, and (α+ω) in rest of the as-cast and quenched alloys.

It is found that Fe prefers to be in substitutional sites in the bulk region and in interstitial sites at grain boundaries of α-Ti. The main contribution to solubility is provided by strongly bound Fe-Fe complexes. At certain conditions segregation of iron can provide notable stabilization of grain boundaries, reducing their energy by more than 200mJ/m2. Finally, it is shown that precipitation of Fe at Ti grain boundary is a favorable process that occurred without nucleation barriers.},

In this work, the solute properties of Si and P, their interaction with point defect, vacancy-mediated migration energies were obtained through first-principles cal­ culations, and the diffusion behavior of solutes and vacancies are evaluated by both methods by solving the Onsager matrix. The solution energies of Si and P in the antiferromagnetic (0 0 1) double-layer with face-centered tetragonal structure (fct\_afmD) Fe imply their relative high solubility. Vacancies can be attracted by Si and P at 1NN sites with the binding energies of 0.12 {\textasciitilde} 0.19 eV, and 0.30 {\textasciitilde} 0.42 eV, respectively. The vacancy wind and the ratio of tracer diffusion coefficient demonstrate that Si and P will be dragged by vacancy, diffuse faster than that of Fe, and strongly promote vacancy diffusion at low temperature while they have weak inhibition at high temperature. Simultaneously, as a function of temperature, compared to the phenomenological Manning method, the results of the Green-function method generally exhibit a left shift. Furthermore, Si and P are also found to attract the self-interstitial atoms (SIAs). Our results indicate that solutes Si and P can both welcome vacancies and SIAs, promote vacancy diffusion at low temperature, in which the effect of P is much stronger than that of Si. Therefore, their addition to austenitic steels may be beneficial to enhance recombination rates of vacancy and SIAs, drop of net defect concentrations and result in a reduction of the rates of void growth under irradiation.},

Results from postirradiation examinations of the AFC-3A and AFC-3B are presented here. In this irradiation, U alloyed with Mo, Zr, and Zr with Pd were investigated. Different geometric forms (solid, annular), smear densities and bonding media (sodium, helium) were also irradiated and evaluated. All fuel forms were irradiated in ferritic-martensitic HT-9 cladding. Examination of the irradiated fuel included neutron radiography, evaluation of the distribution of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides, dimensional inspection, fission gas release analysis, optical microscopy, and chemical analysis. No in-pile failure was observed with this fuel. Neutron radiography, gamma spectrometry, and dimensional inspections indicated the fuel largely performed acceptably. Optical microscopy revealed significant fuel-cladding interaction between the Mo based alloys and the cladding. The Zr based alloys generally performed better although some forms revealed behaviors that present specific fabrication challenges such as tighter fabrication tolerances that will need to be better controlled to match historical U-Zr fuel performance. The addition of Pd as an additive to prevent fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) also appears to present some challenges to fuel performance.},

It is clear that the richness of physical phenomena for these compounds is a result of partially filled 3d, 4f or 5f electron shells with local magnetic moments preserved in the solid state. Strong interactions of d and f electrons with each other and with itinerant electronic states of the material are responsible for its anomalous properties. Electronic structure calculations for strongly correlated materials should explicitly take into account Coulombic interactions between d or f electrons. Recent advances in this field are related to the development of the LDA+DMFT method, which combines local density approximation (LDA) with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to account for electronic correlation effects. In recent years, LDA+DMFT has allowed the successful treatment not only of simple systems but also of complicated real compounds. Nowadays, the LDA+DMFT method is the state-of-the-art tool for investigating correlated metals and insulators, spin and metal–insulator transitions (MIT) in transition-metal compounds in paramagnetic and magnetically ordered phases.},

The theory is based on the master equation which gives the evolution with time of the distribution function of the system. While at equilibrium the distribution function depends on the configurational Hamiltonian, in the general case it is expressed by a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian. The zero-order self consistent approximation consists in considering only the effective pairwise interactions. Kinetic equations are written to zero order for a stationary state close to equilibrium, from which we infer the analytical expression of the transport coefficients (both diagonal and off-diagonal) in a homogeneous binary solid solution with a vacancy diffusion mechanism. These expressions depend on the configurational Hamiltonian pairwise interactions, the attempt jump frequencies, the alloy composition and the correlation factor for selfdiffusion which reflects the crystallographic structure. They are then compared with Monte Carlo values, obtained from the fluctuation—dissipation theorem. The agreement for the bcc structure is better than 20\% over the whole composition range, for a positive as well as a negative heat of mixing. In the pure material, the theory yields the exact value of the correlation factor. Comparisons with the Manning relations and the other microscopic approaches are discussed.},

The Dyson equation solves for the Green function in the presence of a solute with arbitrary but ﬁnite interaction range to compute the transport coeﬃcients accurately, eﬃciently and automatically, including cases with very large diﬀerences in solute-vacancy exchange rates. The methodology takes advantage of the space group symmetry of a crystal to reduce the complexity of the matrix inversion in the Dyson equation.

Nd is employed as a local burnup indicator for conventional oxide fuels due, among other reasons, to its low mobility in the UO2 fuel matrix and its high fission product yield. As part of the studies necessary to determine whether Nd can be considered as a candidate burnup indicator in the U3Si2 concept fuel, we investigate the mobility of Nd in U3Si2. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to predict the most stable accommodation sites of Nd in U3Si2, found to be within the uranium sublattice. Based on DFT calculations of binding energies and migration activation energies, we investigate Nd diffusion by computing the transport coefficients within the framework of the self-consistent mean-field method. Our calculations predict that the diffusion ratio of Nd to U is smaller in U3Si2 than in UO2. Moreover, at the individual maximum centerline temperature of the fuel, the diffusion of Nd in U3Si2 is much slower than in UO2. From this perspective, Nd represents a good candidate burnup indicator, in similarity to that in UO2.},

	abstract = {The sectioning technique and the half-life method of isotope discrimination were used to study the relative rates of diffusion of Zn65 and Zn69m, and of Cd109 and Cd115 in high-purity zinc single crystals. The isotope effect, Eαβ=(1−DαDβ)⎡⎢⎣1−(mβmα)12⎤⎥⎦, was measured; DαDβ and mαmβ are the ratios of the diffusion coefficients and of the masses of the two isotopes α and β, respectively. The average of the values of E6569 at 411.6 and 382.8°C for diffusion of zinc isotopes in zinc, parallel to the hexagonal axis, is 0.669±0.024, whereas the corresponding value perpendicular to the hexagonal axis is 0.687±0.022. These results are consistent with diffusion by vacancy (basal and nonbasal) mechanisms and appear to rule out the interstitial, ring, interstitialcy, and crowdion as the dominant mechanism. The observed isotope effect, both for parallel and perpendicular diffusions, is thus about 13\% less than the value predicted on the basis of the inverse-square-root mass dependence of the atomic jump frequency, i.e., the correlation factor for self-diffusion. This deviation is apparently due to many-body aspects of diffusion, and on these considerations it is concluded that a small fraction (about 13\%) of the translational kinetic energy of the activated state is possessed by atoms other than the jumping atom. At 410.1°C, the values of E109115 for diffusion of cadmium isotopes in zinc, parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal axis, are 0.507±0.034 and 0.317±0.032, respectively. These values indicate an attractive interaction between the cadmium impurity and the vacancy, the interaction being larger when both of them are in the same basal plane. Under the assumption that the many-body consideration is essentially the same as for self-diffusion, and by making some reasonable simplifying approximations as to how the presence of the impurity influences the vacancy jump, the enhancement of cadmium diffusion over zinc diffusion is examined. It is found that the rapid interchange of the cadmium impurity with the vacancy and the greater density of the vacancies next to the cadmium impurity are both responsible for the enhancement in the diffusivity of cadmium in zinc.},

Minimum energy pathways for impurity diffusion and associated saddle point structures were computed with the climbing image nudged elastic band method. Vibrational properties were obtained with the supercell (direct) method for lattice dynamics. Calculated diffusion coefficients were compared with available experimental data.

For diffusion within a basal plane, the same trend holds except that DMg–Zn overlaps with DMg–Al at high temperatures and DMg–Sn at low temperatures. These trends were explored with charge density contours in selected planes of each Mg–X alloy, the variation of the activation energy for diffusion with the atomic radius of each impurity and the electronic density of states.

	abstract = {The screening theory proposed by Lazarus has been used to examine the impurity diffusion in zinc. The difference in the activation energies (ΔQ) for the impurity diffusion and self-diffusion in zinc have been calculated using a screened Coulomb interaction between the vacancy and the excess charge Ze of the impurity ion. The change in the energy of formation of a vacancy next to the impurity ion is calculated by considering the electrostatic interaction between the impurity ion and the vacancy when they are nearest neighbors. In a saddle-point configuration, the diffusion ion may be assumed to be flanked by two half-vacancies. The change in the energy of motion has been calculated by considering the electrostatic interaction between the two half-vacancies and the impurity ion in the saddle-point configuration. Correlation corrections have been calculated using the expressions for the correlation factors. The estimated differences in activation energies for trivalent and monovalent impurities in zinc have been compared with the available experimental data. The estimated values check fairly well in the case of indium and gold, whereas the agreement is poor in the case of silver. Correlation corrections are important for a trivalent impurity, whereas the diffusional jumps of the monovalent impurity are relatively uncorrelated.},

	abstract = {Fuel-cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) is a phenomenon that occurs at the fuel-cladding interface during the irradiation of U-Zr and U-Pu-Zr metallic nuclear fuel and stainless steel cladding. The inter-diffusion zone that develops places both the fuel and cladding at risk through the reduction in cladding strength and the formation of a (U,Pu)/Fe eutectic in the fuel. Due to the impact FCCI has on limiting fuel pin burnup, there is a need for better understanding of the governing FCCI mechanisms in order to make accurate predictions using fuel-performance codes. By performing a critical review of previous work, the physics of FCCI can be separated into individual phenomena so that targeted models can be developed for each. Through examination of experiments conducted both in- and out-of-reactor, the behavior of lanthanides provides a natural separation of models by tracking their behavior through (1) production and transport in the fuel to the clad, (2) interaction with macroscopic changes in fuel topography including cracking and swelling, and finally (3) inter-diffusion at the fuel-cladding interface. Informed by past experience, phenomenological models can be built for each separate effect and subsequently combined in an integral fuel-performance simulation. Prototypical simulation approaches at each level have been included, as well as suggestions for several experiments to help bolster the understanding of irradiated fuel. A robust and predictive FCCI model will provide fuel-performance codes with the ability to predict clad failure and/or fuel eutectic melting. Armed with this information, advanced concepts such as palladium doped fuel, ODS steels, or mitigating reactor designs may be able to reduce FCCI enough to extend fuel burnup beyond its current limits, potentially boosting safety margins and reducing cost through higher fuel utilization.},

	abstract = {The revised second edition of this established text offers readers a significantly expanded introduction to the effects of radiation on metals and alloys. It describes the various processes that occur when energetic particles strike a solid, inducing changes to the physical and mechanical properties of the material. Specifically it covers particle interaction with the metals and alloys used in nuclear reactor cores and hence subject to intense radiation fields. It describes the basics of particle-atom interaction for a range of particle types, the amount and spatial extent of the resulting radiation damage, the physical effects of irradiation and the changes in mechanical behavior of irradiated metals and alloys.Updated throughout, some major enhancements for the new edition include improved treatment of low- and intermediate-energy elastic collisions and stopping power, expanded sections on molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo methodologies describing collision cascade evolution, new treatment of the multi-frequency model of diffusion, numerous examples of RIS in austenitic and ferritic-martensitic alloys, expanded treatment of in-cascade defect clustering, cluster evolution, and cluster mobility, new discussion of void behavior near grain boundaries, a new section on ion beam assisted deposition, and reorganization of hardening, creep and fracture of irradiated materials (Chaps 12-14) to provide a smoother and more integrated transition between the topics.The book also contains two new chapters. Chapter 15 focuses on the fundamentals of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, covering forms of corrosion, corrosion thermodynamics, corrosion kinetics, polarization theory, passivity, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. Chapter 16 extends this treatment and considers the effects of irradiation on corrosion and environmentally assisted corrosion, including the effects of irradiation on water chemistry and the mechanisms of irradiation-induced stress corrosion cracking. The book maintains the previous style, concepts are developed systematically and quantitatively, supported by worked examples, references for further reading and end-of-chapter problem sets. Aimed primarily at students of materials sciences and nuclear engineering, the book will also provide a valuable resource for academic and industrial research professionals.Reviews of the first edition:"...nomenclature, problems and separate bibliography at the end of each chapter allow to the reader to reach a straightforward understanding of the subject, part by part. ... this book is very pleasant to read, well documented and can be seen as a very good introduction to the effects of irradiation on matter, or as a good references compilation for experimented readers." - Pauly Nicolas, Physicalia Magazine, Vol. 30 (1), 2008“The text provides enough fundamental material to explain the science and theory behind radiation effects in solids, but is also written at a high enough level to be useful for professional scientists. Its organization suits a graduate level materials or nuclear science course... the text was written by a noted expert and active researcher in the field of radiation effects in metals, the selection and organization of the material is excellent... may well become a necessary reference for graduate students and researchers in radiation materials science.” - L.M.

It is found that (i) both the bulk and shear moduli of Ni-X decrease approximately linearly with increasing equilibrium volume, especially within each group of 3d, 4d, or 5d transition-metal alloying elements; (ii) all alloying elements considered herein increase the ratio of bulk to shear modulus (i.e., the ductility) and the elastic anisotropy of the Ni-X alloys; and (iii) the largest decrease of elastic properties of Ni is caused by alloying element Y. It is observed that the change of elastic properties of Ni due to various alloying elements is traceable from the distribution of (magnetization) charge density, for instance the spherical distribution of charge density facilitates shear deformation, resulting in a lower shear-related property. Using a proposed quasistatic approach based on the predicted elasticity-volume-temperature relationship, the isothermal and the isentropic elastic properties are predicted for the dilute Ni-X alloys at finite temperatures, displaying a decreasing trend with respect to temperature for each Ni-X system. Computed elastic properties are in favorable accord with available experimental data.},

	abstract = {A systematic study of stacking fault energy (γSF) resulting from induced alias shear deformation has been performed by means of first-principles calculations for dilute Ni-base superalloys (Ni23X and Ni71X) for various alloying elements (X) as a function of temperature. Twenty-six alloying elements are considered, i.e., Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr. The temperature dependence of γSF is computed using the proposed quasistatic approach based on a predicted γSF–volume–temperature relationship. Besides γSF, equilibrium volume and the normalized stacking fault energy (ΓSF = γSF/Gb, with G the shear modulus and b the Burgers vector) are also studied as a function of temperature for the 26 alloying elements. The following conclusions are obtained: all alloying elements X studied herein decrease the γSF of fcc Ni, approximately the further the alloying element X is from Ni on the periodic table, the larger the decrease of γSF for the dilute Ni–X alloy, and roughly the γSF of Ni–X decreases with increasing equilibrium volume. In addition, the values of γSF for all Ni–X systems decrease with increasing temperature (except for Ni–Cr at higher Cr content), and the largest decrease is observed for pure Ni. Similar to the case of the shear modulus, the variation of γSF for Ni–X systems due to various alloying elements is traceable from the distribution of (magnetization) charge density: the spherical distribution of charge density around a Ni atom, especially a smaller sphere, results in a lower value of γSF due to the facility of redistribution of charges. Computed stacking fault energies and the related properties are in favorable accord with available experimental and theoretical data.},

We use density functional theory to calculate these defect energies, including the formation energies of vacancies, self interstitials, and metallic impurities in substitutional and interstitial positions in hcp Ti. We ﬁnd that for normal diffusers the vacancy mediated diffusion mechanism dominates, while for fast diffusers the dominant mechanism is hopping directly between interstitial sites. The activation energy for the latter mechanism is signiﬁcantly lower than that for vacancy mediated diffusion, explaining the large diffusivities and low activation energies observed experimentally for these fast diffusing impurities.},

	abstract = {In this report, multi-scale simulations to develop a mechanistic model of fuel-cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) conducted under the auspices of the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program in FY23 are described. The model assumes that cladding wastage is dominated by the intermetallic phase (Fe,Cr)\$\_\{17\}\$Nd\$\_2\$, and calculates production and diffusion of Nd in the fuel, diffusion into the cladding, and formation and growth of the intermetallic wastage layer. Atomistic simulations are used to calculate diffusivity of Nd in the (Fe,Cr) system. Mesoscale simulations, informed by previous atomistic calculations, are used to determine the effective diffusivity of Nd through the fuel, accounting for empty and sodium-filled porosity within the fuel. The BISON model incorporates this data and calculates the wastage layer thickness as a function of time, assuming parabolic growth kinetics based on the best available data. The results of the new mechanistic BISON model are compared to existing assessment cases for the X447 experiment in EBR-II, and show good agreement with experimental data and the existing BISON empirical model. To improve predictions of kinetics for future work, a phase-field model that includes fuel, wastage, and cladding phases is developed. Preliminary testing indicates that the kinetics may differ significantly from the assumed parabolic growth law, suggesting direction for future improvement of the model that will allow it to be applied to other fuel designs with greater confidence.},

	abstract = {Starting in the 1950s, significant efforts have been devoted to developing metallic nuclear fuels for use in sodium fast reactors. During irradiation, one performance limitation for this type of fuel is fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI), which occurs after the fuel swells and contacts the cladding. This can cause formation of interaction zones on the cladding inner surface that have low mechanical strength and that can contain relatively low-melting phases. Significant in-pile and out-of-pile research has been performed to improve understanding of how FCCI affects fuel performance and also to identify ways to mitigate and possibly eliminate this phenomenon. In celebration of the diamond anniversary for the Journal of Nuclear Materials, this paper reviews and highlights key aspects of the metallic fuel FCCI research performed over the last 60 years, and discusses some of the most current research being performed today.},

U–10wt.\%Zr and HT9 disks were used as fuel and cladding material to conduct diffusion couple annealing tests at 740 and 800°C. Two kinds of Cr layers dependent on the temperature of plating bath were electroplated on the surface of the HT9 disks. The Cr layer of 20μm in thickness, after being electroplated at a bath temperature of 50°C and a current density of 35A/dm2 for 1h, had some cracks and a small-grained structure. However, the Cr layer plated at a bath temperature of 80°C and a current density of 56A/dm2 for 2h showed a dense structure. Both Cr layers inhibited the interaction between U–10wt.\%Zr and HT9 at a relatively high annealing temperature. U penetrated into the Cr layer plated at a bath temperature of 50°C due to its penetrable structure. The Cr layer plated at a bath temperature of 80°C showed a better performance than the Cr layer plated at a bath temperature of 50°C as a diffusion barrier material with less U penetration.},

The anticipated elevated temperature and high neutron flux can significantly aggravate the FCCI, in terms of formation of inter-diffusion and lower melting point eutectic phases. To mitigate the FCCI, vanadium carbide coating as a diffusion barrier was deposited on the HT-9 substrate using a pack cementation diffusion coating (PCDC) method, and the processing temperature was optimized down to 730°C. A solid metallurgical bonding between the coating layer and substrate was achieved, and the coating is free from through depth cracks. The microstructural characterizations using SEM and TEM show a nanostructured grain structure. EDS/WDS and XRD analysis confirm the phase of coating layer as V2C. Diffusion couple tests at 660°C for 100h demonstrate that V2C layer with a thickness of less than 5μm can effectively eliminate the inter-diffusion between the lanthanide cerium and HT-9 steel.},

Composition profiles were obtained by scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of sections cut from the diffusion couples. The presence of specific reaction products was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. At temperatures of 993 K and above, the neodymium flake rapidly became liquid as the diffusion and dissolution of iron into it depressed the melting temperature. At higher temperatures, a single reaction product, Fe17Nd2, was found, whereas, at 953 K, two reaction products, Fe17Nd2 and Fe17Nd5, were formed. The diffusion reactions were quasisteady state and growth of the reaction products obeyed a parabolic law. Wagner's theory has been used to calculate the interdiffusion coefficient for both products. Data for the reaction product Fe17Nd2 obeyed the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy of 127 ± 28 kJ mol−1 and an interdiffusion constant of (8 ± 11) × 10−7 m2s−1.},

Results showed that strong lanthanides-vacancy binding, steep migration barriers and low vacancy concentration could lead to poor vacancy mobility in the vicinity of Ln in Cr. The Ln diffusion coefficients can be 4–8 orders of magnitude lower in Cr than those in Fe, confirming remarkable mitigating effects of Cr on Ln diffusion. Charge transfer and localization in the Cr matrix are analyzed to be responsible for the steep migration barriers.

The vacancy mechanism is considered to be the dominant mechanism for the bulk diffusion of Nd since a Nd interstitial is found to be intrinsically unstable in α-U. The surface diffusivity of a Nd adatom on α-U (001) surface has been further predicted using KMC simulations parameterized by DFT calculations. The present study suggests that Nd transport via the surface diffusion mechanism can be many orders of magnitude faster than bulk diffusion.

It is found that if the effect of the interstitial flux is neutral, then solute segregation can occur at sinks because of differences in the vacancy diffusion coefficients of the alloy constituents. The theory predicts that slow-diffusing solutes will be enriched at sinks, as observed in Fe-Cr-Ni alloys. It is pointed out that one consequence of segregation is that an extra vacancy flux (the 'Kirkendall flux') is induced, which opposes the radiation induced flux to the sink.

	abstract = {During the past decade, computer simulations based on a quantum-mechanical description of the interactions between electrons and between electrons and atomic nuclei have developed an increasingly important impact on solid-state physics and chemistry and on materials science—promoting not only a deeper understanding, but also the possibility to contribute significantly to materials design for future technologies. This development is based on two important columns: (i) The improved description of electronic many-body effects within density-functional theory (DFT) and the upcoming post-DFT methods. (ii) The implementation of the new functionals and many-body techniques within highly efficient, stable, and versatile computer codes, which allow to exploit the potential of modern computer architectures. In this review, I discuss the implementation of various DFT functionals [local-density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid functional mixing DFT, and exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange] and post-DFT approaches [DFT + U for strong electronic correlations in narrow bands, many-body perturbation theory (GW) for quasiparticle spectra, dynamical correlation effects via the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (AC-FDT)] in the Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP. VASP is a plane-wave all-electron code using the projector-augmented wave method to describe the electron-core interaction. The code uses fast iterative techniques for the diagonalization of the DFT Hamiltonian and allows to perform total-energy calculations and structural optimizations for systems with thousands of atoms and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for ensembles with a few hundred atoms extending over several tens of ps. Applications in many different areas (structure and phase stability, mechanical and dynamical properties, liquids, glasses and quasicrystals, magnetism and magnetic nanostructures, semiconductors and insulators, surfaces, interfaces and thin films, chemical reactions, and catalysis) are reviewed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The swelling of these materials was obtained from a determination of the immersion density of the unirradiated and irradiated materials. The swelling of V is substantially increased by the addition of Cr, and significantly reduced by the addition of Ti. The swelling of V-Cr-Ti alloys is strongly dependent on Ti concentration for Ti concentrations {\textless} 3\%. For resistance to irradiation-induced swelling, the Ti concentration in a V-Cr-Ti alloy that is to be used as a structural material in a magnetic fusion reactor should be greater than 3\%. For these ranges of Ti concentration in a V-Cr-Ti alloy, Cr concentrations of {\textless} 15\% have minimal effect on the swelling of the alloy. The Vanstar-7 alloy exhibits high (7–10\%) swelling on irradiation at 600 °C to 77 dpa. Swelling of V-7.2Cr-14.5Ti, V-13.5Cr-5.2Ti, V-9.2Cr-4.9Ti, V-3.1Ti-(0.3–0.5)Si, and V-17.7Ti on neutron irradiation at 600°C to 87 dpa is (in \% per dpa) 0.10, 0.03, 0.03, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively.},

High self-diffusion rates and low dislocation bias may contribute to their intrinsic swelling resistance. Other factors, such as high sink densities, are metallurgically mediated and may not be permanent. Further, low helium generation rates in FM alloys may contribute significantly to the low swelling observed in fast reactor irradiations. Helium generation is environmentally mediated, and higher levels generated in mixed spectrum reactors increase void swelling. FM alloys also lose their advantageous helium-to-dpa ratio in fusion spectra. The implications of these factors are evaluated with critical bubble-to-void and rate theory swelling models using austenitic alloys as a reference base.},

The incubation period, a transient stage before the steady void growth, determines the duration of service of nuclear materials. Several experimental studies have been performed on void observations by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which, however, has a resolution limit for the size of defect clusters. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) enables the detection of small vacancy clusters, single vacancies, dislocations and precipitates. The use of these two methods provides complementary information toward detecting defect information in the incubation period. Here, defect structures during the incubation period in austenitic stainless steels, by means of PALS and TEM are reviewed. The role of alloying elements into determining the period is explained.

	abstract = {Many rate theory models of cavity (void) swelling have been published over the past 50 years, all having the same, or similar, structures. A rigorous validation of the models has not been possible because of the dearth of information concerning the microstructures that correspond with the swelling data. Whereas the lack of microstructure information is still an issue for historical swelling data, in the past 10–20 years data have been published on the evolution of the microstructure (point defect yields from collision cascades, cavity number densities, and dislocation densities/yield strengths) allowing certain gaps in information to be filled when considering historic swelling data. With reasonable estimates of key microstructure parameters, a standard rate theory model can be applied, and the model parameter space explored, in connection with historical swelling data. By using published data on: (i) yield strength as a function of dose and temperature (to establish an empirical expression for dislocation density evolution); (ii) cavity number densities as a function of temperature; and (iii) freely migrating defect (FMD) production as a function of primary knock-on atom (PKA) spectrum, the necessary parameter and microstructure inputs that were previously unknown can be used in model development.

Much effort has been spent to predict swelling resistance, with the goal of increasing the void swelling incubation dose so as to postpone the consequences of radiation damage. However, this trial-and-error approach is highly inefficient due to the time- and resource-intensive nature of both experiments and physics-based multiscale simulations. In this work, as a first attempt, machine learning is applied to perform this prediction based on available experimental data. Of the multiple techniques applied, the gradient boosting ensemble method best predicts experimental onset doses for swelling in test datasets, and identifies the main contributing factors such as temperature, Fe and Cr content, and dose rate, which are consistent with established understanding. This work demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning to predict macroscale radiation effects based on material and environmental parameters, and has practical significance in guiding further material optimization for nuclear applications.},

We studied the void swelling in stress-relieved (SR) additively manufactured (AM) 316L stainless steel (SS) in comparison with hot-isostatic pressed (HIP) AM 316L counterparts with identical chemistry. To understand the role of dislocation cell structure in SR AM 316L SS, we also included cold-worked (CW) 316L SS with various CW levels for dislocation networks. The irradiation damage of 30 displacements per atom (dpa) in AM and CW 316L SSs were compared after 5 MeV Fe2+ ion irradiations at 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C, respectively. To investigate the temperature and dose dependence, the AM 316L SSs were further irradiated to 100 dpa at 400 °C and 600 °C. Results show that the void welling in SR AM 316L SS is more severe than in HIP AM 316L SS, in terms of a higher void density and a deeper void nucleation depth through all the examined conditions. This is ascribed to a more extended incubation period in HIP AM 316L SS. Beyond the incubation, both samples proceeded at a similar swelling rate. Dislocation networks from cold-working can effectively suppress void swelling, while dislocation cell structures containing entangled dislocations on cell walls cannot. The distinct responses indicate the potential influence of dislocation configuration on void swelling. Despite some relevant data are available, our understandings of radiation damage in AM 316L SSs are still limited.},

Many fast neutron irradiations were performed in the past to understand the swelling variation as a function of the Cr content. However, due to some contrasting results in the literature, the trend is not yet clear. For that purpose, we have performed self-ion irradiations to high doses ({\textgreater}100 dpa) at 773 K, in single beam mode (damage by 2 MeV self ions) and dual beam mode (damage by 2 MeV self-ions and co-implantation of 2 MeV helium ions with continuous energy degradation) on a wide range of high purity Fe–Cr alloys with Cr level ranging from 3 wt.\% to 14 wt.\% and a reference body centred cubic (bcc) iron (Fe). Conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed a strong swelling suppression by the addition of 3 wt.\% Cr to the Fe matrix. The analysis of the dual beam irradiated samples revealed that the variation of void swelling as a function of the Cr content is non-monotonic, with a local swelling maxima around 9–10 wt.\% Cr. Overall, all the Fe–Cr alloys up to 14 wt.\% Cr show much reduced swelling as compared to bcc Fe. No cavities, and hence, swelling, was noted in the single beam irradiated Fe–Cr alloys, while the same in bcc Fe remained high. This elucidates further the large magnitude of swelling reduction by Cr.},

	abstract = {Austenitic stainless steels are used for core internal structures in sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) and light-water reactors (LWRs) because of their high strength and retained toughness after irradiation (up to 80 dpa in LWRs), unlike ferritic steels that are embrittled at low doses ({\textless}1 dpa). For fast reactors, operating temperatures vary from 400 to 550 ◦C for the internal structures and up to 650 ◦C for the fuel cladding. The internal structures of the LWRs operate at temperatures between approximately 270 and 320 ◦C although some parts can be hotter (more than 400 ◦C) because of localised nuclear heating. The ongoing operability relies on being able to understand and predict how the mechanical properties and dimensional stability change over extended periods of operation. Test reactor irradiations and power reactor operating experience over more than 50 years has resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of data from which one can assess the effects of irradiation on the properties of austenitic stainless steels. The effect of irradiation on the intrinsic mechanical properties (strength, ductility, toughness, etc.) and dimensional stability derived from in- and out-reactor (post-irradiation) measurements and tests will be described and discussed. The main observations will be assessed using radiation damage and gas production models. Rate theory models will be used to show how the microstructural changes during irradiation affect mechanical properties and dimensional stability.},

An earlier analysis showed that this effect could not be accounted for in terms of enhanced point defect recombination at particle-matrix interfaces. The behavior of the iron phosphide phase has been further examined using dual ion beam irradiations. It was found that the particle-matrix interface serves as a site for the nucleation of a very fine dispersion of helium bubbles. It is thought that since a high number density of cavities lowers the number of helium atoms per cavity, the irradiation time for the cavities to accumulate the critical number of gas atoms for biasdriven growth is correspondingly increased. Although the phosphide phase nucleates rapidly, it eventually undergoes dissolution if either the G or Laves phase develops with increasing dose.},

The γ' forms at temperatures below {\textasciitilde}525°C and increases in volume function tion with fluence. While the emergence of this phase is coincident with the onset of substantial swelling, there is no direct association of voids and γ' particles. At temperatures higher than the γ' regime, other precipitates, including M23(C, Si)6 predominate. Void formation is also coincident with the emergence of the M23(C, Si)6 phase and usually involves a void-precipitate association. Formation of these precipitates depletes the austenite matrix of silicon and possibly other eleme which exert a strong influence on void nucleation. A model is presented which relates the high relative partial diffusivity silicon to a depression of the void nucleation rate. Removal of silicon from the matrix then leads to an enhanced nucleat rate.
Résumé
Une phase inattendue γ' identifiée comme étant Ni3Si a été observée au cours de l'étude de l'acier inoxydable 316 irradié sous fluence élevée de neutrons. La phase γ' se forme aux températures inférieures à 525°C et augmente en fraction volumique avec la fluence tandis que l'apparition de cette phase coincide avec l'apparition brutale d'un gonflement important, il n'y a pas association directe entre vides et particules de γ'. Aux températures supérieures à celle du régime γ', d'autres précipités, incluant M23(C, Si)6 prédominent. La formation des vides coincide avec l'apparition de la phase M23(C, Si)6 et an général implique une association vides-précipités. La formation de ces précipités appauvrit la matrice austénitique en Silicium et probablement en d'autres éléments qui sont connus comme exerçant une forte influence sur la germination des vides. Un modèle est présenté qui relie la diffusivité partielle relativement élevée du silicium à une diminution de la vitesse de germination des vides. L'élimination du silicium de la matrice conduit alors à une augmentation de la vitesse de germination.
Zusammenfassung
Eine unerwartete γ'-Phase, als Ni3Si nachgewiesen, wurde während der Untersuchung eines 20\% kaltverformten rostfreien Stahls 316 identifiziert, der mit hoher Neutronendosis bestrahlt worden war. Die γ'-Phase bildet sich unterhalb etwa 525°C, der Volumenanteil nimmt mit der Dosis zu. Während die Entstehung dieser Phase mit dem Beginn einer wesentlichen Schwellung zusammenfällt, gibt es keine unmittelbare Verbindung zwischen Poren und γ'-Teilchen. Bei Temperaturen über der des γ'-Bereichs herrschen andere Ausscheidungen einschliesslich der M23(C, Si)6-Phase vor. Porenbildung tritt ebenfalls mit dem Erscheinen der M23(C, Si)6-Phase auf und beinhaltet gewöhnlich ein Pore-Ausscheidung-Assoziat. Durch die Bildung dieser Ausscheidungen wird die Austenitmatrix an Silicium und möglicherweise anderen Elementen verarmt, die bekanntermassen einen starken Einfluss auf die Porenbildung ausüben. Es wird ein Modell dargelegt, das das hohe relative partielle Diffusionsvermögen des Siliciums mit einer Erniedrigung der Porenbildungsrate korreliert. Das Verschwinden von Silicium aus der Matrix führt dann zu einer erhöhten Keimbildungsrate.},

In the current study, the microstructural evolution of a U-10 wt.\%Zr fuel neutron irradiated to a burnup of 5.7 at.\% was investigated using scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and selected area electron diffraction to determine the major phases, alterations in microstructure, and variations in local chemical composition at different localities of a fuel cross-section. The current study revealed that the irradiated U-10 wt.\%Zr fuel was comprised of various major phases, including α-U, β-U, and δ-UZr2, as well as amorphous and crystalline solid fission product (FP) precipitates within different regions of the fuel cross-section. Regions A and A/B in the center of the fuel were comprised of U-rich, U-intermediate, and U-lean localities with α-U and δ-UZr2 composing the major phases. Regions B and C in the intermediate and peripheral fuel localities, respectively, were comprised of α-U grains, U-rich (β-U) grains with Zr-rich precipitates, U-intermediate grains (δ-UZr2), and solid FP precipitates. The major phases identified were associated with the nanoscopic chemical concentrations, the phase diagram, and the as-characterized specimen temperature, with the exception of the non-equilibrium β-U phase identified in Region B. The U-lean localities in Regions A, A/B, B, and C were Zrenriched pathways along subgrain/grain boundaries, suggesting that Zr is susceptible to radiation-induced segregation in U-Zr fuels and indicating a new mechanism for constituent redistribution.},

The influence of the masses of the various atoms on the effective frequency is investigated. It is shown that an effective mass which depends on the direction of the path through the saddle point in configuration space determines this frequency. In the case of chemical diffusion by the vacancy mechanism the effective mass is approximately the same as the mass of the solute atom, and must always lie between the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent. It is finally shown that the classical rate theory, even with many-body considerations, is unable to explain the recent observations of Lazarus and Okkerse on the isotope effect in the diffusion of iron in silver.},

	abstract = {The high-temperature mechanical properties of precipitate-strengthened advanced alloys can be heavily inﬂuenced by adjusting chemical composition. The widely-accepted argument within the community is that, under certain temperature and loading conditions, plasticity occurs only in the matrix, and dislocations have to rely on thermally-activated climb mechanisms to overcome the barriers to glide posed by the hard precipitates. This is the case for γ0-strengthened Ni-based superalloys. The presence of dilute amounts of slow-diffusing solute atoms, such as Re and W, in the softer matrix phase is thought to reduce plasticity by retarding the climb of dislocations at the interface with the hard precipitate phase. One hypothesis is that the presence of these solutes must hinder the ﬂow of vacancies, which are essential to the climb process. In this work, density functional theory calculations are used to inform two analytical models to describe the effect of solute atoms on the diffusion of vacancies. Results suggest that slow-diffusing solute atoms are not effective at reducing the diffusion of vacancies in these systems.},

Here we examined the vacancy diffusion in nickel under a wide range of pressure and temperature with the aid of collective variable-driven hyperdynamics (CVHD), which is challenging for traditional molecular dynamics (MD) due to its intrinsic femtosecond time step. In line with previous studies, the vacancy diffusivity in nickel decreases when the hydrostatic pressure increases. Interestingly, the total diffusion rate increases when the uniaxial stress is applied, and the diffusion becomes anisotropic. Additionally, vacancy diffusivity becomes less dependent on either hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial stress when the temperature increases. This work provides in-depth atomistic insights into the diffusion phenomenon in nickel, which could be beneficial for unveiling the damage mechanisms and the design of next-generation Ni-based high-temperature alloys.},

Fission product lanthanide accumulation at high burnup is substantial and significantly contributes to FCCI upon migration to the cladding interface. Diffusion barriers are typically used to prevent interaction of the lanthanides with the cladding. A more active method has been proposed which immobilizes the lanthanides through formation of stable compounds with an additive. Theoretical analysis showed that indium, thallium, and antimony are good candidates. Indium was the strongest candidate because of its low reactivity with iron-based cladding alloys. Characterization of the as-fabricated alloys was performed to determine the effectiveness of the indium addition in forming compounds with lanthanides, represented by cerium. Tests to examine how effectively the dopant prevents lanthanide migration under a thermal gradient were also performed. The results showed that indium effectively prevented cerium migration.},

The diffusion behavior of the Zr thin film on Zr foil was investigated using misch metal (Ce: 75\% and La: 25\%) as fuel fission product, in order to effectively simulate nuclear fuel. While without the Zr barrier substantial inter-diffusion occurred at the interface between the ferritic/martensitic HT9 cladding material and misch metal, the Zr thin film on Zr foil exhibited excellent resistance to interdiffusion. The enhancement of the barrier ability of the Zr thin film on Zr foil was attributed to a lower amount of defects induced by the Zr thin film layer.},

In this paper, helium, xenon, and krypton point defects are investigated in the a and c phases of metallic uranium using ﬁrst principles calculations. A density functional theory (DFT) framework is utilized with projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. Formation and incorporation energies of He, Xe, and Kr are calculated at various defect positions for the prediction of ﬁssion gas behavior in uranium. In most cases, defect energies follow a size effect, with helium incorporation and formation energies being the smallest. The most likely position for the larger Xe and Kr atoms in uranium is the substitutional site. Helium atoms are likely to be found in a wide variety of defect positions due to the comparable formation energies of all defect conﬁgurations analyzed.

The α-U and δ-UZr2 transformation took place simultaneously in the U-30 wt.\% Zr sample. These findings strengthen the need to re-approach the U-Zr phase diagram in entirety. Bulk volumetric CTEs agree well with published data, strengthening the quantification of lattice-specific CTEs reported in this study. A compositionally dependent discontinuity in thermal expansion, increasing in magnitude with decreasing U content, occurs during the γ-U-Zr→α-U+δ-UZr2 transformation.

The proposed method optimizes the shape of the supercell jointly with the occupation of the atomic sites, thus ensuring that the configurational space searched is exhaustive and not biased by a pre-specified supercell shape. The method has been implemented in the “mcsqs” code of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) in the most general framework of multicomponent multisublattice systems and in a way that minimizes the amount of input information the user needs to specify and that allows for efficient parallelization.},

The c11, c33, and c44 differ considerably among the three metals, whereas the c66 shear moduli for Ti and Zr are similar to within 1\% between 4 and 300°K and less than 10\% at 1100°K. There is very marked anisotropy in the temperature dependence of the shear moduli in Ti and Zr, c66 decreasing by 75\% between 4 and 1100°K whereas c44 decreases by 40\%. A very pronounced deviation from a linear temperature dependence of c66 occurs at a temperature which coincides with the anomalous curvatures in the published electrical resistivity data. The relatively small c66 shear moduli at the hcp → bcc phase transformation temperatures are as expected from the transformation shear mechanisms suggested by Burger. A survey of existing elastic modulus and thermal expansion data in hcp metals leads to the conclusion that a relatively high temperature dependence in c66 and the occurrence of hcp → bcc transformations are characteristic of metals with ca{\textless}1.60. It is suggested that these characteristics due to the transverse thermal vibrations in the basal planes, and that the transformation results from anharmonic contributions to the free energy which are indicated by specific heat data. Contrary to comparison in other hcp metals, the Debye θ from 4°K elastic moduli in Ti, Zr, and Hf are in excellent agreement with published specific heat data. A slight anomaly at 18°K in Ti is indicated which may be associated with published resistivity minima in Ti alloys.},

The formalism is applied to vacancy-interstitial solute pairs in α−Fe (VX pairs, X = C, N, O), with ab initio based thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Convergence of the cluster mobility contribution gives a controlled estimation of the cluster definition distance, taking into account both its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Then, the flux-coupling behavior of each VX pair is discussed, and qualitative understanding is achieved from the comparison between various contributions to the Onsager matrix.

Also, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) was argued to advance the aforementioned properties in these systems. We demonstrate, contrarily, that neither the Hubbard U approach nor SOC is necessary for a correct description of uranium metal and U-Zr alloys. We further illustrate that the combination of DFT+U and SOC in the projector augmented-wave calculations by Xie et al. results in unrealistically large volume expansions, particularly for γ-U, in stark contrast to all previous calculations for elemental uranium. This in turn may also explain why the DFT+U with SOC model predicts negative enthalpy of mixing in the U-Zr alloy system contradicting conventional DFT as well as one of the main features of the experimental U-Zr phase diagram. The assertion by Xie et al. that DFT+U is an improvement over DFT for these systems is illustrated to be incorrect.},

The modeling results are then used to determine the phenomenological coefﬁcient matrices and the tracer diffusion coefﬁcients for both vacancy and interstitial mediated diffusion. In addition to predicting diffusion coefﬁcients, this ab initio-based approach provides information typically inaccessible to experiments, including the different contributions to diffusion (e.g., electronic excitation effects), the species dependence of interstitial diffusion, and the deviations from Arrhenius-type relations, which are often used to describe and extrapolate experimental diffusion data. It is found that: (1) Cr is the fastest diffusing species in Ni by both vacancy and interstitial diffusion, followed by Fe and then Ni. The enhanced diffusivity of Cr is primarily due to differences in migration barriers and binding energies, not pre-exponential factors. (2) Fe and Cr solutes in Ni have weak interactions with vacancies but Cr solutes bind strongly to interstitial defects. (3) Cr exhibits non-Arrhenius behavior in both vacancy and interstitial mediated diffusion. (4) Temperature dependent electronic contributions have a signiﬁcant impact on the diffusion in some cases.

The implementation of the self-consistent mean ﬁeld method in the KineCluE code allows for the calculation of transport coefﬁcients extended to arbitrary interaction ranges, crystal structures, and diffusion mechanisms. In addition, the code gives access to the diffusion and dissociation rates of small solute-defect clusters À in this case, vacancy- and dumbbell-solute pairs. The results show that the diffusivity of P, Mn, and Cr solute atoms is dominated by the dumbbell mechanism, that of Cu by vacancies, while the two mechanisms might be in competition for Ni and Si, despite the fact that the corresponding mixed dumbbells are not stable. Systematic positive radiation-induced segregation (RIS) at defect sinks is expected for P and Mn solutes due to dumbbell diffusion, and for Si due mainly to vacancy drag. Vacancy drag is also responsible for Cu and Ni enrichment at sinks below 1085 K. The RIS behavior of Cr is the outcome of a ﬁne balance between enrichment due to the dumbbell diffusion mechanism and depletion due to the vacancy one. Therefore, for dilute Cr concentrations global enrichment occurs below 540 K, and depletion above. This threshold temperature grows with solute concentration. The ﬁndings are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations of RIS and clustering phenomena, and conﬁrm that solute-defect kinetic coupling plays an important role in the formation of solute clusters in reactor pressure vessel steels and other alloys.},

	abstract = {Diffusion regulates a vast number of materials properties and phenomena such as creep, the focus of the present work. However, a deep understanding of the effect of how each alloying element in a Ni-base superalloy affects properties such as diffusion and creep is far from complete. Here, we report temperature-dependent dilute solute diffusion coefficients and their implications to tailor the creep rate for 26 transition metal solute elements, X's, in fcc Ni using first-principles calculations. Calculations are performed using the five-frequency model for dilute solute diffusion and the nudged elastic band method within the local density approximation. Thermodynamic properties at finite temperatures for all configurations are calculated using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. In general, the fastest diffusing solute elements in Ni are found at the left side of the periodic table and the slowest diffusing solute elements are found in group VIIB. In particular, the present work indicates that the diffusivity of the dilute solute elements is correlated to the compressibility of each solute element on the respective Ni31X supercell, and not as strongly to the ionic radius of the solute elements, as previously suggested. Finally, results from the diffusivity study are combined with the previous results of elastic constants and stacking fault energies, and hence, a relative creep rate ratio for these 26 solute elements is modeled. It is shown that in most cases, slower diffusing solute elements provide the most creep resistance. This is true even at higher temperatures, due mainly to the solute's strong bonding with Ni atoms in the host lattice.},

The segregation energies of each element and site were comprehensively calculated for nine [0 0 1] symmetric tilt grain boundary models with Σ values from 5 to 41; the paramagnetic state was simulated by the antiferromagnetic double-layer (AFMD). By calculating the effective segregation energy for each grain boundary model from the obtained segregation energies, the grain boundary segregation behavior for each alloying element and its dependence on the grain boundary character were investigated. The segregation energy of transition metal elements is dominated by the Voronoi volume of Fe at the segregation site and arises from the elastic energy derived from the difference in atomic radii between the host and solute metals. Ti, Cu, Nb, and Mo have negative effective segregation energies (indicating a tendency toward segregation) at all investigated grain boundaries, and the absolute values of the effective segregation energy increase in the order of Cu {\textless} Mo {\textless} Ti {\textless} Nb in all of the grain boundary models. In contrast, the sign of the effective segregation energies for V, Ni, and Co changes depending on the grain boundary, and the effective segregation energies for Cr and Mn are positive at all grain boundaries. These results corresponded well with the experimental results. The results obtained in this study provide important basic data for the material design of high-strength steels and are useful for understanding the effects of alloying elements in γFe.},

The presence of Cr leads to faster SFT formation and high Ni diffusion in Ni-Cr binary systems than in pure Ni and Ni-Fe binary systems. The same trend is observed for the ternary systems that have high Cr composition. This Cr-induced effect is due to the low Cr migration barrier that first induces vacancy diffusion and later leads to faster clustering and SFT formation. We find that the fast Ni diffusion is also Cr-induced, where the binding of two vacancies provides much lower migration barrier pathways for Ni diffusion. Due to this ‘Cr-effect’, the vacancy-vacancy pair distribution shows higher peaks in Ni-Cr and Ni-Fe-Cr systems than in pure Ni and Ni-Fe binary systems. The low migration barriers of Cr compared to Ni and Fe are confirmed by density functional theory calculations.},

            In this paper we report a new fundamental understanding of chemically-biased diffusion in Ni–Fe random alloys that is tuned/controlled by the intrinsic quantifiable chemical complexity. Development of radiation-tolerant alloys has been a long-standing challenge. Here we show how intrinsic chemical complexity can be utilized to guide the atomic diffusion and suppress radiation damage. The influence of chemical complexity is shown by the example of interstitial atom (IA) diffusion that is the most important defect in radiation effects. We use μs-scale molecular dynamics to reveal sluggish diffusion and percolation of IAs in concentrated Ni–Fe alloys. We develop a mean field diffusion model to take into account the effect of migrating defect energy properties on diffusion percolation, which is verified by a new kinetic Monte Carlo approach addressing detailed processes. We demonstrate that the local variations in the ground state energy of IA configurations in alloys, reflecting the chemical difference between alloying components, drives the percolation effects for atomic diffusion. Percolation, chemically-biased and sluggish diffusion are phenomena that are directly related to the chemical complexity intrinsically to multicomponent alloys.},

	abstract = {Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising nuclear fuel that combines the advantageous properties of readily used UO2 and uranium alloys, such as high melting temperature and high uranium density, and thermal conductivity, respectively. A better understanding of UN behavior at operating temperatures can be obtained from finite temperature data, such as elastic properties. To get this information, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed at five different temperatures using constant volume (NVT) and constant pressure (NPT) ensembles. Initially, the performance of PBE functional in reproducing experimental crystallographic properties and magnetic ordering is assessed. The finite temperature phonon dispersions are calculated using NVT simulation results, which show a softening of the phonon modes with increasing temperature. The NPT results are used to obtain the thermal expansion of UN and finite temperature electronic properties. The calculated thermal expansion is compared with our measurements using neutron diffraction. Additionally, the temperature dependent elastic properties of UN are evaluated using the strain-stress method in AIMD simulations, indicating that UN becomes softer and more compressible with increasing temperature. Also, the calculated Young’s modulus slope is in very good agreement with the experiment. The finite temperature heat capacity and electronic thermal conductivity are calculated from AIMD simulations, which are in better agreement with the experiment than the heat capacity and thermal conductivity calculated using the structures relaxed at 0 K. Lastly, the thermal diffusivity from AIMD has opposite temperature dependence compared to experimental results, which we argued comes from the underestimated electronic thermal conductivity.},

DFT is used to study stability of various conﬁgurations of vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and migration barriers. The data are used in kinetic Monte Carlo modeling of defect diﬀusion at diﬀerent temperatures. It is found that both defects exhibit anisotropic diﬀusion, predominantly parallel to the basal planes. The ratio of diﬀusion coeﬃcients parallel and perpendicular to the basal planes is found to be higher for vacancies as compared to SIAs at temperatures below \$600 K. This raises doubts that the observed radiation growth in Zr irradiated with 1 MeV electrons, namely positive strains in prismatic and negative strains in basal directions, and void alignment along basal planes, can be accounted for by the anisotropy of point defect diﬀusion, which predicts opposite strain signs. It is speculated that formation of small SIA clusters with higher diﬀusion anisotropy may be responsible for the experimental observations.},

Expressions for sink strength and bias that include the saddle-point shape effect are derived, both in the absence and presence of an externally applied stress. These are found to depend on instrinsic parameters such as the relaxation volume and the saddle-point shape of the point defects, and on extrinsic parameters such as temperature and the magnitude and direction of the externally applied stress with respect to the line direction and Burgers-vector direction of the dislocation. The theory is applied to fcc copper and bcc iron. It is found that the stress-induced bias differential for edge dislocations depends much more on the line direction than on the Burgers-vector direction. The origin of this strong line-direction dependence is shown to be unrelated to the dislocation strain field, but is solely a consequence of elastodiffusion and the translational symmetry of the dislocation line. Comparison is made with the stress-induced bias differential due to the usual stress-induced preferred absorption effect. It is found that the shape effect causes a bias differential that is more than an order of magnitude larger.},

When subjected to simultaneous mechanical loading and irradiation, structural materials exhibit a visco-plastic deformation phenomenon, referred to as irradiation creep, which can be more rapid than the deformation occurring out of irradiation. In this chapter, the phenomenology of this peculiar behavior is described after a short history of its discovery. Then, the theoretical mechanisms proposed in the literature during these past 60 years are presented, with a special focus on mechanisms based on stress induced preferred absorption of point defects by dislocation loops, dislocations and grain boundaries and on mechanisms based on climb-enhanced glide of dislocations. These mechanisms are discussed in the light of experimental evidences. Finally, irradiation creep in various materials, such as zirconium alloys, austenitic stainless steels, nickel-based alloys, ferritic steels, ferritic-martensitic and also graphite, is described.},

The dimensional stability, and the ability to predict dimensional changes, of components made from zirconium alloys is important to designers and operators of such reactors because deformation has a consequence for the operability or life of the reactor core. The dimensional changes in zirconium alloys due to neutron irradiation has been the subject of intense study since the inception of the thermal nuclear power reactor. During irradiation zirconium alloys behave differently from most other engineering alloys in that they resist swelling. They do exhibit anisotropic dimensional changes in the absence of an applied stress that depend on the microstructure; this process is called irradiation growth. Like any other material they also exhibit a dimensional response to an applied stress; this process is called irradiation creep. In this review the evolution in measurement methodologies (either from controlled experiments in materials test reactors or gauging of power reactor components) is described together with the results gleaned from such measurements. As measurements have improved and the amount of experimental and operational data has increased, the theoretical basis for modelling creep and growth has also evolved. The history of the evolution in understanding and the ability to predict dimensional changes in zirconium alloys over the past 60e70 years is described and discussed.},

The first part is devoted to the creep experiments, which were conducted in the OSIRIS or SILOE metallurgical test reactors using argon internally pressurized cladding tubes to simulate the normal operating conditions in PWRs. The studied materials are the following Zr-base alloys: stress-relieved (SRA) and fully recrystallized (RXA) low tin Zircaloy-4, the RXA Zr-SnFeV M4 alloy and the FRAMATOME-ANP Zr-1\%NbO (M5\{sup TM\}). The effects of the alloy composition and metallurgical condition, temperature (280 to 380 deg C), stress level (0 to 120 MPa), and fast neutron flux (1 to 2 X 10\{sup 18\} n/m\{sup 2\}s, E \&gt; 1 MeV) on the irradiation creep kinetics are discussed. These irradiation creep results confirm the lower creep rate of RXA Zy-4, M4, and M5\{sup TM\} with respect to SRA Zy-4. In the second part, this paper relates to the clad behavior under pellet-cladding interaction conditions. To this end, a specific irradiation device operated at a nominal temperature of 350 deg C is used to strain a cladding tube sample at high stress level (about 400 MPa by internal -pressure) and under neutron flux (2 X 10\{sup 18\} n/m\{sup 2\}s, E \&gt; 1 MeV). The diameter elongation is measured online versus time. The results are compared to those obtained during out-of-pile creep tests on irradiated specimens using similar temperature and stress conditions. This experiment allows discussion of the contribution of irradiation-induced creep with respect to the thermal creep at high stress levels relevant to PCI conditions. (authors)},

The measured activation energies for creep correlated with the activation energies for zirconium self-diffusion. Thus, dislocation climb, rather than the often assumed glide mechanism, appears to be rate controlling. The common zirconium alloys (i. e., Zircaloys) have higher creep strength than zirconium. The stress exponents of the creep data in the five-power-law regime were determined to be 4.8 and 5.0 for Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4, respectively.

However, significant uncertainty presently exists about which elements are vacancy vs. interstitial diffusers, which can inhibit understanding and prediction of their behavior under different temperature, irradiation, and alloying conditions. Therefore, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been employed to predict the temperature-dependent dilute impurity diffusion coefficients for 14 substitutional alloying elements in hexagonal closed packed (HCP) Zr. Vacancy-mediated diffusion was modeled with the eight-frequency model. Interstitial contributions to diffusion are estimated from interstitial formation and select migration energies. Formation energies for each impurity in nine high-symmetry interstitial sites were determined, including significant effects of thermal expansion. The dominant diffusion mechanism of each solute in HCP Zr was identified in terms of the calculated vacancy-mediated activation energy, lower and upper bounds of interstitial activation energy, and the formation entropy, suggesting a rough relation with the metallic radii of solutes. It is predicted that Cr, Cu, V, Zn, Mo, W, Au, Ag, Al, Nb, Ta and Ti all diffuse predominantly by an interstitial mechanism, while Hf, Zr, and Sn are likely to be predominantly vacancy-mediated diffusers at low temperature and interstitial diffusers at high temperature, although the identification of mechanisms for these elements at high-temperature is quite uncertain.},

	abstract = {Zirconium alloys are the most widely used nuclear fuel cladding materials for light water power reactors where irradiation damage causes solute redistribution, leading to degradation of alloy properties such as corrosion resistance. Designing radiation-tolerant zirconium alloys requires a thorough understanding of the atomic-scale transport behavior of the alloying elements in Zr. We perform density function theory calculations to investigate the diffusion of Sn, Cr, Fe, Be, Al, and Ni in the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) Zr matrix. We develop a methodology to accurately model the metastable vacancy states along the basal migration path, known to occur in group IV metals. We compute the vacancy-mediated solute diffusion coefficients and drag ratios using the kinetic Monte Carlo method and an analytic Green's function method—the agreement between the two validates our methodology. The computed diffusion coefficients of Sn and Al show good agreement with the experimental data and we expect these solutes to diffuse via the vacancy-mediated mechanism. We use a Green's function approach, parameterized with data from density functional theory calculations, to compute the interstitial diffusion coefficients of Cr, Fe, Be, and Ni in the HCP Zr lattice. The computed diffusion coefficients of Cr, Ni, and Be agree with the experimental measurements within one order of magnitude, while those of Fe are within two orders of magnitude of the experimental measurements. The drag ratios for Cr, Fe, Be, and Ni are positive up to 1235 K, which suggests that nonequilibrium vacancy fluxes could drag these solutes toward sinks such as dislocation loops and grain boundaries. We also compute the transport coefficients without including the metastable states, and using the eight- and thirteen-frequency model. Our results show significant differences in drag ratio for the eight- and thirteen-frequency model predictions compared with the Green's function methodology, but smaller errors in the solute diffusivity. Combining interstitial and vacancy-mediated diffusivities, we predict the unusual result that increased vacancy concentration slows down solute diffusivity, while a sufficiently high vacancy concentration can change the dominant mechanism to an accelerated vacancy-mediated diffusion.},

It covers the dependence of creep and growth on test conditions (neutron flux and fluence, temperature and stress) and material variables (composition, texture, cold-work, grain size and microstructure), together with irradiation-induced changes in density and microstructure. A brief account is given of the acceleration of growth in certain zirconium alloys at high fluences (growth breakaway) as well as evidence for breakaway creep.

	abstract = {Uranium (U) is often alloyed with molybdenum (Mo) or zirconium (Zr) in order to stabilize its high-temperature body-centered cubic phase for use in nuclear reactors. However, in all metallic fuel forms, the α phase of U remains in some fraction. This phase decomposition due to temperature or compositional variance can play an outsized role on fuel performance and microstructural evolution. Relatively little is known about fundamental point defect properties in α-U at non-zero temperatures, from either computational or experimental studies. This work performs the first thorough evaluation of the α phase of U via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). A number of thermophysical properties are calculated as a function of temperature, including equilibrium lattice parameters, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. These results indicate a two-region behavior, with the transition at 400 K. The thermal expansion/contraction in the a/b direction occurs rapidly from 100 up to 400 K, after which a more linear and gradual change in the lattice constant takes place. The volumetric expansion matches experiments quantitatively, but the individual lattice constant expansion only matches experiments qualitatively. Point defect formation energies and induced lattice strains are also determined as a function of temperature, providing insight on defect populations and the fundamentals of irradiation growth in α-U. Interstitials induce significantly more strain than vacancies, and the nature of that strain is highly dependent on the individual lattice directions. The direction of point defect-induced lattice strain is contrary to the irradiation growth behavior of α-U. This work shows that isolated point defects cannot be the primary driving force responsible for the significant irradiation-induced growth of α-U observed experimentally.},

One such application involves U–Zr as nuclear fuel, where radiation damage and diffusion (processes heavily dependent on point defects) are of vital importance. Several systems of U are examined within a density functional theory framework utilizing projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. Two separate generalized gradient approximations of the exchange-correlation are used to calculate defect properties and are compared. The bulk modulus, the lattice constant, and the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state for the defect free bcc uranium allotrope are calculated. Defect parameters calculated include energies of formation of vacancies in the α and γ allotropes, as well as self-interstitials, Zr interstitials, and Zr substitutional defects for the γ allotrope. The results for vacancies agree very well with experimental and previous computational studies. The most probable self-interstitial site in γ-U is the ⟨110⟩ dumbbell, and the most probable defect location for dilute Zr in γ-U is the substitutional site. This is the first detailed study of self-defects in the bcc allotrope of U and also the first comprehensive study of dilute Zr defects in γ-U.},

	abstract = {Ion-beam irradiation has been conducted to demonstrate and assess solid phase dependence of fission gas bubble nucleation and growth in metallic nuclear fuels. Differential formation and growth of irradiation-induced voids and bubbles were observed from as-cast uranium-zirconium (U–Zr) alloys including 0.1 and 40 wt\% zirconium. The U–Zr alloys were irradiated with 140-keV He+ ions with fluences ranged from 1 × 1014 ions/cm2 to 5 × 1016 ions/cm2. Several larger spherical bubbles ({\textless}∼70 nm) were revealed from an irradiated single α-U phase alloy (U–0.1Zr) in which observed bubbles were mobile under 200-keV electron beam of transmission electron microscope (TEM). In-situ mergence and leakage of the bubbles in the uranium-rich alloy was also evident during the observation. In contrast, numerous number of small (∼6 nm) angular voids, or low pressure bubbles, were found in an irradiated δ-UZr2 phase alloy (U–40Zr), in which the radiation-induced nanostructure was stationary throughout the observation. This study may reaffirm higher radiation-susceptibility of the α-U phase than the δ-UZr2 phase, which could strengthen the needs of separate accounting of solid phase effects for metallic fuel performance modeling particularly regarding the fuel restructuring phenomena, such as fission gas swelling and constituent redistribution, since conventional models are commonly adopted homogeneous medium assumption, not in accordance with the results of post-irradiation examinations of used metallic nuclear fuel in which the formation of several concentric phase zone was distinct corresponding to a steep radial temperature gradient in the fuel pin and multiple isotherm lines in the binary phase diagram of U–Zr alloy system.},

	abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s−d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

	abstract = {Zr alloys are commonly used materials for in-core components of pressurized water reactors. The evolution of defects in Zr under irradiation conditions will directly contribute to the degradation of reactor components. For a better understanding of the evolution process of defects in Zr, a multiscale simulation was performed to study the diffusion behavior of radiation-induced point defects. Because the existing potentials cannot accurately describe the energy differences of stable states self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) in Zr, an embedded atom method potential that can exactly reproduce the energy difference between metastable states and ground states, and the binding energy of divacancy of Zr, was first developed by fitting a potential to point defect properties calculated by density functional theory and other basic crystal properties. Based on the constructed potential, molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the migration of point defects. We determined several frequent migration paths of SIAs by kinetic study, which is rarely reported in previous MD studies. The SIA exhibits obvious anisotropic diffusion characteristics at low temperatures ({\textless}600 K). The most frequent migration path for SIAs is the jump between the two nearest basal octahedral (BO) sites in the basal plane, which means that SIAs diffuse faster along the basal plane than along the c axis. It is found that diffusion within the basal plane tends to be two-dimensional (2D) diffusion rather than 1D diffusion, and there is a significant correlation effect for diffusion of SIAs along the basal plane. Additionally, the existence of trivacancy-SIA complex was found in the process of divacancy migration, which can inhibit divacancy migration. Monovacancies and divacancies exhibit anisotropic diffusion characteristics in the considered temperature range Divacancies have a much faster diffusion rate than monovacancies in the present MD simulation and can easily dissociate at high temperatures ({\textgreater}900 K). The rapid migration of the divacancies may contribute to the formation of vacancy dislocation loops. These results are meaningful to understand the evolution process of radiation-induced defects.},

	abstract = {The influence of stress, temperature, grain size and subgrain size on the steady state creep rate of polycrystalline unalloyed tungsten has been examined based on the extensive published data available. It was shown that the steady state creep rate of polycrystalline tungsten, and other metals, is given by ϵ̇ = Sλ2Deff(σE)7 where λ = subgrain size, σ = creep stress, E = average unrelaxed elastic modulus, and S is a universal creep constant equal to about 3 × 1040 cm−4. The effective diffusion coefficient, Deff, equals (DLƒL + DDƒD) where DL is the lattice diffusion coefficient, DD is the dislocation diffusion coefficient, and ƒL and D are the fraction of atoms participating in lattice and dislocation diffusion respectively. When subgrains form during creep, as in normal behaving materials, λ = kσ−1 (k is a material constant) and the above equation yields the generally observed five power stress law for creep. When subgrains do not form during creep (as in many refractory metals produced by powder metallurgy techniques), λ in the above equation is replaced by the grain size. In this case ϵ̇αL7 and ϵ̇;αL2, predictions in agreement with experimental evidence. The power law breakdown for creep at high stresses can be explained by one of two possibilities 1.(i) the creation of excess vacancies by plastic deformation which increases DL in the Deff term2.(ii) the increase in dislocation density with increasing stress, which influences the dislocation diffusion term, DDƒD, in Deff.
Résumé
Les auteurs ont examiné l'influence de la contrainte, de la température, de la taille des grains et de la taille des sous-grains sur la vitesse de fluage en régime permanent pour le tungstène polycristallin non allié, en prenant pour base les résultats valables publiés antérieurement. On montre que la vitesse de fluage en régime permanent pour le tungstène polycristallin et pour d'autres métaux est donnée par la relation ϵ̇ = Sλ2Deff(σE)7 où λ est la taille des sous-grains, σ la contrainte de fluage, E le module élastique moyen non relaxé et S une constante de fluage universelle égale à 3 × 1040 cm−4 environ. Le coefficient de diffusion effective Deff est égal à DLƒL + DDƒD où DL est le coefficient de diffusion dans le réseau, DD le coefficient de diffusion le long des dislocations, et où ƒL et ƒD sont les fractions d'atomes participant respectivement à la diffusion dans le réseau et le long des dislocations Quand des sous-grains se forment pendant le fluage, comme dans les métaux qui se comportent normalement, λ = kσa−1 (k étant une constante physique) et l'équation ci-dessus donne, comme habituellement pour le fluage, la contrainte à la puissance cinq. Quand des sous-grains ne se forment pas au cours du fluage (comme dans de nombreux métaux réfractaires produits par les techniques de la métallurgie des poudres), λ est remplacé dans l'équation ci-dessus par la taille du grain. Dans ce cas les valeurs prévues pour ϵ̇ασ7 et ϵ̇αL2 sont en accord avec les résultats expérimentaux. Le fait que la loi ne convient plus pour des contraintes de fluage élevées peut être expliqué par l'une des deux possibilités suivantes 1.(i), la création de lacunes en excès par la déformation plastique, ce qui augmente DL dans le terme Deff2.(ii), l'accroissement de la densité des dislocations quand la contrainte augmente, ce qui se répercute sur le terme de diffusion le long des dislocations DDƒD dans Deff.
Zusammenfassung
Der Einfluß der Schubspannung, Temperatur, Korngroße und Größe der Subkörner auf die statische Kriechgeschwindigkeit polykristallinen, unlegierten Wolframs wurde an Hand der zahlreichen veröffent-lichten Daten untersucht. Es wurde gezeigt, daß die statische Kriechgeschwindigkeit polykristallinen Wolframs und anderer Metalle durch die Gleichung ϵ̇ = Sλ2Deff(σE)7 gegeben ist, wobei A die Größe der Subkörner, σ die Kriechspannung, E der mittlere, unrelaxierte E-Modul, S eine universale Kriechkonstante der ungefähren Größe 3 × 1040 cm−3 ist. Der effektive Diffusionskoeffizient Deff ist gleich (DLƒL ± DDƒD), wobei DL der Gitterdiffusionskoeffizient, DL der Versetzungsdiffusionskoeffizient und ƒL und ƒD die Anteile der Atome, die an Gitterdiffusion bzw. Diffusion entlang Versetzungskernen teilnehmen, sind. Wenn, wie in sich normal verhaltenden Materialien, sich Subkörner während des Kriechens bilden, dann ist λ = kσ−1 (k ist eine Materialskonstante) und die oben angeschriebene Gleichung ergibt das allgemein beobachtet σ5-Gesetz. Bilden sich während des Kriechens keine Subkörner (wie in vielen feuerfesten, pulvermetallurgisch hergestellten Metallen), so wird λ in obiger Gleichung durch die Korngröße ersetzt. In diesem Fall sind die Vorhersagen ϵ̇ ∼ σ7 und ϵ̇ ≈ L2 in Übereinstimmung mit experimentellen Ergebnissen. Das Versagen des Potenzgesetzes bei hohen Kriechspannungen hat zwei mögliche Erklärungen 1.(1) Die Bildung von Überschußleerstellen während der plastischen Verformung hat eine Zunahme von DL im Deff-Term zur Folge2.(2) die Zunahme der Versetzungsdichte mit zunehmender Schubspannung beeinflußt den Anteil der Versetzungsdiffusion DDƒD) von Deff.},

	abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) approach to computing transition metal oxide heat of formation without adjustable parameters is presented. Different degrees of d-electron localization in oxides are treated within the DFT+U approach with site-dependent, first-principles Hubbard U-parameters obtained from linear response theory, and delocalized states in the metallic phases are treated without Hubbard corrections. Comparison of relative stabilities of these differently treated phases is enabled by a local d-electron density matrix-dependent model, which was found by genetic programming against experimental reference formation enthalpies. This mathematically simple model does not explicitly depend on the Hubbard-corrected ionic species and is shown to reproduce the heats of formation of the Mott insulators Ca2RuO4 and Y2Ru2O7 within ∼3\% of experimental results, where the experimental training data did not contain Ru oxides. This newly developed method thus absolves from the need for element-specific corrections fitted to experiments in existing Hubbard-corrected approaches to the prediction of reaction energies of transition metal oxides and metals. The absence of fitting parameters opens up here the possibility to predict relative thermodynamic stabilities and reaction energies involving d-states of varying degree of localization at transition metal oxide interfaces and defects, where site-dependent U-parameters will be particularly important and devising a fitting scheme against experimental data with predictive power would be exceedingly difficult.},

	abstract = {Binary uranium silicides have been thoroughly reinvestigated with respect to crystal chemistry and magnetic properties; for most compounds, magnetic studies have been carried out at low temperatures for the first time (2 to 300 K, 0 to 5 T). Formation of all known binary silicides has been confirmed: U3Si, U3Si2 (U3Si2-type), USi (USi-type), U3Si5 (defect AlB2-type), USi1.88 (defect ThSi2-type) and USi3 (Cu3Au-type). At the composition U3Si∼5 three different phases have been observed: the defect AlB2-type as well as a phase separation into two orthorhombically distorted Alb2-type related phases. USi2−x with the tetragonal defect ThSi2-type structure at its silicon poor phase boundary was found to be in equilibrium with USi2−x of the orthorhombic defect GdSi2 type. Precise U-U distances have been derived from X-ray single crystal counter data for U3Si2, USi, for the AlB2-type subcell of U3Si5, and for USi1.84 (defect ThSi2-type). From susceptibility measurements, a band type paramagnetism was observed for U3Si2, whereas a temperature independent paramagnetism was confirmed for USi3. Curie-Weiss paramagnetism was encountered within the investigated temperature range for U3Si5 and USi1.88. A modified Curie-Weiss law was revealed for USi with the USi-type, whereas ferromagnetic ordering at Tc = 125 K was observed for the oxygen stabilized “USi” with the FeB-type. Magnetism of the uranium silicides is discussed as a function of the distant dependent 5f-5f electron overlap and d-f electron hybridization. No superconductivity was observed above 2 K.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation of self-trapped holes (STH) in three prototypical perovskites (SrTiO3, BaTiO3, PbTiO3) using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations with local potentials and hybrid functionals. First we construct a local correction potential for polaronic configurations in SrTiO3 that is applied via the DFT+U method and matches the forces from hybrid calculations. We then use the DFT+U potential to search the configuration space and locate the lowest energy STH configuration. It is demonstrated that both the DFT+U potential and the hybrid functional yield a piece-wise linear dependence of the total energy on the occupation of the STH level suggesting that self-interaction effects have been properly removed. The DFT+U model is found to be transferable to BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, and formation energies from DFT+U and hybrid calculations are in close agreement for all three materials. STH formation is found to be energetically favorable in SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 but not in PbTiO3, which can be rationalized by considering the alignment of the valence band edges on an absolute energy scale. In the case of PbTiO3 the strong coupling between Pb 6s and O 2p states lifts the valence band minimum (VBM) compared to SrTiO3 and BaTiO3. This reduces the separation between VBM and STH level and renders the STH configuration metastable with respect to delocalization (band hole state). We expect that the present approach can be adapted to study STH formation also oxides with different crystal structures and chemical composition.},

We find that the degree of non-stoichiometry in U3Si2 is much smaller than in UO2 and at most reaches a few percent at high temperature. Non-stoichiometry impacts fuel performance by determining whether the loss of uranium due to fission leads to a non-stoichiometric U3Si2±x phase or precipitation of a second U-Si phase.

However, the thermodynamic stability of the more recently reported adjacent U5Si4 phase is uncertain and could play a significant role in fuel performance. In this work, the enthalpy of formation of the phase predicted by density functional theory (DFT) using the DFT + U formalism is used with an evolutionary algorithm (USPEX) to evaluate stability and possible atomic structures for U5Si4. The structure of U-Si convex hull phases and the confirmed U3Si2 structure were predicted providing confidence in the reliability of the evolutionary algorithm, as well as to obtain a convex hull with comparable enthalpies of formation. Subsequently, the code was applied to the U5Si4 composition for cells with 18 and 36 atoms, predicting a 36-atom hexagonal symmetrized unit cell with space group P6/mmm as the lowest-energy configuration, agreeing with that experimentally reported for U5Si4. Yet, phonon calculations using the density functional perturbation theory formalism, demonstrated that the predicted structure is dynamically unstable, exhibiting negative vibrational modes for the uranium. These indicated that generated shears are directed toward the formation of potential uranium octahedral sites, analogous to those occupied by carbon atoms in U20Si16C3. It was thus concluded that omitting the U5Si4 phase from assessed U-Si phase equilibria is currently justified.},

	abstract = {Triuranium disilicide (U3Si2) fuel with silicon carbide (SiC) composite cladding is being considered as an advanced concept/accident tolerant fuel for light water reactors thus, understanding their chemical compatibility under operational and accident conditions is paramount. Here we provide a comprehensive view of the interaction between U3Si2 and SiC by utilizing density functional theory calculations supported by diffusion couple experiments. From the calculated reaction energies, we demonstrate that triuranium pentasilicide (U3Si5), uranium carbide (UC), U20Si16C3, and uranium silicide (USi) phases can form at the interface. A detailed study of U3Si2 and SiC defect formation energies of the equilibrated materials yielding the interfacial phases U20Si16C3, U3Si5 and UC reveal a thermodynamic driving force for generating defects in both fuel and cladding. The absence of either the U3Si2 or SiC phase, however, causes the defect formation energies in the other phase to be positive, removing the driving force for additional interfacial reactions. The diffusion couple experiments confirm the conclusion with demonstrated restricted formation of U3Si5, UC, and U20Si16C3/USi phases at the interface. The resulting lack of continuous interaction between the U3Si2 and SiC, reflects the diminishing driving force for defect formation, demonstrating the substantial stability of this fuel-cladding system.},

	abstract = {The intermetallic compound U3Si2 has received interest in recent years for use as accident tolerant fuels in light water reactors due to its combination of high thermal conductivity, reasonably high melting point, and high uranium density compared to UO2. Although U3Si2 is well characterized there are ucertainties about the remaining phases in the U–Si system which could be potential fission products of the silicide fuel. In an effort to better detail the U–Si binary phase diagram, the 44–60 at.\% Si region of the U–Si phase diagram was investigated experimentally by analyzing samples with nominal compositions U/Si = 5/4, U/Si = 1/1 and U/Si = 2/3 using SEM-EDS, XRD, and high temperature time-of-flight neutron diffraction, supported by DFT calculations. Both the U/Si = 5/4 and the U/Si = 2/3 samples were composed of two phases, U3Si2 + USi and USi + U3Si5 for U/Si = 5/4 and U/Si = 2/3, respectively. Both U5Si4 and U2Si3 were found from DFT calculations to have imaginary phonon frequencies and an enthalpy of formation above the U–Si convex hull, and thus likely to be thermodynamically unstable compared to the other phases, consistent with the experimental results. In the literature there are three different structures that are proposed for the USi phase, and for the first time, high temperature neutron diffraction measurements were collected on the compound synthesized with the U/Si = 1/1 composition to verify the correct structure. The structure of the USi phase was confirmed to be tetragonal with the I4/mmm space group from room temperature to 1100 °C. The USin crystal structure has 6 U atom sites and 8 Si atoms sites of which two are partially occupied.},

Out-of-pile testing of the cladding alternatives has continued and samples have been irradiated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Reactor and the Halden Project Reactor. Uranium silicide fuel is undergoing exposure in the Advanced Test Reactor and fuel pins have been removed and have undergone post irradiation examination at the Idaho National Laboratory. Out-of-reactor testing on U3Si2 fuel has revealed a need for additional oxidation protection and these programs are underway. A business case has been developed on the value of ATF for both fuel costs and operational savings which have indicated limited operational savings but significant fuel savings for 18 and 24 month cycles. In parallel, a licensing approach has been developed and is under discussion with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

In comparison with current UO2-Zr system, FeCrAl has a better oxidation resistance but a larger thermal neutron absorption cross section. U3Si2 has a higher thermal conductivity and a higher uranium density, which can compensate the reactivity suppressed by FeCrAl. Based on neutronic investigations, a possible U3Si2-FeCrAl fuel-cladding system is taken into consideration. Fundamental properties of the suggested fuel-cladding combination are investigated in a fuel assembly. These properties include moderator and fuel temperature coefficients, control rods worth, radial power distribution (in a fuel rod), and different void reactivity coefficients. The present work proves that the new combination has less reactivity variation during its service lifetime. Although, compared with the current system, it has a little larger deviation on power distribution and a little less negative temperature coefficient and void reactivity coefficient and its control rods worth is less important, variations of these parameters are less important during the service lifetime of fuel. Hence, U3Si2-FeCrAl system is a potential ATF candidate from a neutronic view.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a model of fission gas behavior in U3Si2 under light water reactor (LWR) conditions for application in engineering fuel performance codes. The model includes components for intra-granular and inter-granular behavior of fission gases. The intra-granular component is based on cluster dynamics and computes the evolution of intra-granular fission gas bubbles and swelling coupled to gas diffusion to grain boundaries. The inter-granular component describes the evolution of grain-boundary fission gas bubbles coupled to fission gas release. Given the lack of experimental data for U3Si2 under LWR conditions, the model is informed with parameters calculated via atomistic simulations. In particular, we derive fission gas diffusivities through density functional theory calculations, and the re-solution rate of fission gas atoms from intra-granular bubbles through binary collision approximation calculations. The developed model is applied to the simulation of an experiment for U3Si2 irradiated under LWR conditions available from the literature. Results point out a credible representation of fission gas swelling and release in U3Si2. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis for the various model parameters. Based on the sensitivity analysis, indications are derived that can help in addressing future research on the characterization of the physical parameters relative to fission gas behavior in U3Si2. The developed model is intended to provide a suitable infrastructure for the engineering scale calculation of fission gas behavior in U3Si2 that exploits a multiscale approach to fill the experimental data gap and can be progressively improved as new lower-length scale calculations and validation data become available.},

	abstract = {Uranium silicide, U3Si2, has been proposed as an advanced nuclear fuel to be used in light water reactors (LWRs). Development of this alternative to the predominant current fuel, UO2, is motivated by enhanced accident tolerance as a result of higher thermal conductivity as well as improved fuel cycle economics through increased uranium density. In order to accurately model the fuel performance of U3Si2, the diffusion rate of point defects, which is related to self-diffusion, and of fission gas atoms must be determined. DFT calculations are used to predict the U and Si point defect concentrations, the corresponding self-diffusivities, the preferred Xe trap site and the Xe diffusivity. Effects of irradiation are not considered. A low defect formation energy and a high entropy for Si interstitials give rise to Si-rich non-stoichiometry at elevated temperatures. Both U and Si self-diffusion and Xe diffusion are anisotropic as a consequence of the tetragonal crystal structure of U3Si2. Si diffusion occurs by interstitial mechanisms in both the a-b plane and along the c axis, while the U c axis diffusion rate is controlled by a vacancy mechanism. Interstitial diffusion of U is very fast in the a-b plane of the U3Si2 crystal structure. Xe atoms prefer to occupy U vacancy trap sites. The highest Xe diffusion rate occurs by a vacancy mechanism in both the a-b plane and along the c axis. The diffusion rate is similar in the a-b plane and along the c axis. U and Si self-diffusion and Xe diffusion are all faster in U3Si2 than intrinsic U and Xe diffusion in conventional UO2 nuclear fuel.},

The harmonic phonon spectrum of a solid is the simplest description of its structural dynamics and can be straightforwardly derived from the Hellman–Feynman forces obtained in a ground-state electronic structure calculation. The presence of imaginary harmonic modes in the spectrum indicates that a structure is not a local minimum on the structural potential-energy surface and is instead a saddle point or a hilltop, for example. This can in turn yield important insight into the fundamental nature and physical properties of a material. In this review article, we discuss the physical significance of imaginary harmonic modes and distinguish between cases where imaginary modes are indicative of such phenomena, and those where they reflect technical problems in the calculations. We outline basic approaches for exploring and renormalising imaginary modes, and demonstrate their utility through a set of three case studies in the materials sciences.},

The formation energy and migration barrier of vacancy and interstitial defects, and the inﬂuence of Zr on these values, is obtained and compared with experimental results. Our results conﬁrm that self-diffusion in pure α U is via a simple vacancy mechanism, and shows anisotropic character. The calculated values of activation energy are consistent with the experimental results in the literature. For interstitial diffusion, the kick-out mechanism was found to have the smallest energy barrier. The calculations of point defects, and later Xe, in U–Zr alloys will provide a foundation for computational modeling of ﬁssion gas bubble nucleation and growth.},

	abstract = {The low electronic conductivity of hematite (α-Fe2O3) limits its best performance in many applications. Though highly reducing conditions induce an intrinsic n-type behavior, reaching extremely low oxygen partial pressure (pO2) values is not practical. Alternatively, certain dopants provide hematite with excess electrons at practical pO2 values. This study employs density functional theory with thermodynamic analysis to compute the concentration of electronic defects in hematite as a function of pO2, upon doping with 1\% of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals. Isothermal Kröger–Vink diagrams at 1100 K are plotted to reveal the charge compensation mechanism controlling the electronic carriers in doped hematite and the maximum attainable pO2 value, which achieves approximately one electron per dopant. A higher pO2 value is a metric for an effective donor. Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W are shown to be effective donors, especially Nb, Ta, and W, which achieve a 1:1 electron/dopant ratio around atmospheric pressure and a maximum electron/dopant ratio greater than one. The latter is a new metric introduced in this study to quantify the doping efficacy of a donor. Moreover, our study shows that W, Ta, and Nb co-doping in specific percentages with any of the other investigated dopants ensures the n-type behavior of the co-doped hematite while opening the possibility of improving other properties via the other dopant. The other dopant can be Ni or Co to enhance the surface catalytic properties or Zn to increase the minority hole carriers. Both properties are desirable in applications such as photoelectrochemical cells.},

              is studied in the non-equilibrium state of thermochemical quenching; that is, rapid cooling starting from a certain high temperature and oxygen chemical potential. This non-equilibrium state is of great interest because many metal oxides are used at low temperatures below their growth temperatures. This paper addresses the importance of considering this non-equilibrium state rather than applying equilibrium thermodynamics as commonly used when studying point defects from first principles. Based on point defect formation energies calculated previously using density functional theory, we compare the type of dominant defects at equilibrium to those at a quenched state originating from a certain initial growth temperature and oxygen partial pressure. The comparison is facilitated by casting the dominant defects in a dominance diagram on the temperature – oxygen partial pressure plane. We consider two scenarios to model the quenched state. In the first, only electronic defects equilibrate whereas all ionic defects are frozen. Whereas, in the second, electronic defects and interstitials are allowed to equilibrate under the assumption of mobile interstitials at low temperatures. We find that new ionic charge compensation modes can appear on the dominance diagram after quenching. Additionally, purely ionic charge compensation modes consisting of vacancies and/or interstitials expand in the dominance diagram at the expense of purely electronic compensation modes. For the ZrO
              2
              phases, we argue that scenario 2 is more realistic and leads to difficulty in achieving n-type doping by thermochemical quenching. For Fe

              3
              , and regardless of the quenching scenario, iron vacancies occupy a wider zone of domination, which limits the performance of this oxide as a water splitting photoanode. Our study shows that by controlling the growth thermochemical conditions, it is possible to tune the Fermi level of oxides over a considerable range within the band gap by quenching. This provides an extra tool to tune the electric conductivity of metal oxides beyond traditional extrinsic doping. This work indicates that non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis is necessary to understand and control defect chemistry at low temperatures.},

Our model suggests that cation diffusion in hematite is mainly controlled by the migration of , while  may contribute to cation diffusion at extremely low

A synergistic comparison of our theoretical model and the experimental results on Ti-doped hematite led us to propose that free electrons and small polarons coexist and both contribute to n-type conductivity. Our validated model of defective hematite is a foundation to study hematite in applications such as corrosion and water splitting.},

The twinned and non-twinned face-centred tetragonal U,Si specimens were prepared employing appropriate heat-treatment regimes. The prescncr of twins in the U,Si lattice yields a modulus defect of about 1X.5y0,the Young's modulus of the twinned U,Si having the lower atwolutc value. At about 85°K the twinned structuro displays a prominent m i n h u m in its elastic properties, suggesting a first-order phase transformation. I n contrast, tho non-twinned U,Si exhibits a maximum in this temperature range. Experimental results are hscussed in terms of the effect of twins on the lattice stability of the tetragonal structure of U,Si.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N3atoms operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N2atoms scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. © 1996 The American Physical Society., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {Density functional theory calculations have been used with spin-orbit coupling and on-site Coulomb correction (GGA þ U) methods to investigate the U-Si system. Structural prediction methods were employed to identify alternate stable structures. Convex hulls of the U-Si system were constructed for each of the methods to highlight the competing energetics of various phases. For GGA calculations, new structures are predicted to be dynamically stable, but these have not been experimentally observed. When the GGA þ U (Ueff {\textgreater} 1.3 eV) method is considered, the experimentally observed structures are predicted to be energetically preferred. Phonon calculations were used to investigate the energy predictions and showed that the use of the GGA þ U method removes the signiﬁcant imaginary frequencies observed for U3Si2 when the correction is not considered. Total and partial electron density of states calculations were also performed to understand the role of GGA þ U methods and orbitals on the bonding and stability of U-Si compounds.},

	abstract = {A new thermodynamic description of the U–Zr system is developed using the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) method with the aid of ab initio calculations. Thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, activities, and enthalpy of mixing, are well predicted using the improved thermodynamic description in this work. The model-predicted enthalpies of formation for the bcc and d phases are in good agreement with the results from DFT + U ab initio calculations. The calculations in this work show better agreements with experimental data comparing with the previous assessments. Using the integrated method of ab initio and CALPHAD modeling, an unexpected relation between the enthalpy of formation of the d phase and energy of Zr with hexagonal structure is revealed and the model improved by ﬁtting these energies together. The present work has demonstrated that ab initio calculations can help support a successful thermodynamic assessment of actinide systems, for which the thermodynamic properties are often difﬁcult to measure.},
