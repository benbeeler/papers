We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

In this work, first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) was used to model the solute behavior in eutectic LiCl–KCl and FLiBe (Li2BeF4) melts at 773 K and 973 K, respectively. The thermo-kinetic properties for solute systems such as the redox potential, solute diffusion coefficients and structural information surrounding the solute were predicted from FPMD modeling and the calculated properties are generally in agreement with the experiments. In particular, we formulate an approach to model redox energetics vs. chlorine (or fluorine) potential from first-principles approaches. This study develops approaches for, and demonstrates the capabilities of, FPMD to model solute properties in molten salts.}

abstract = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the electrochemical reduction process, oxides fuels are loaded at the cathode basket in molten Li2O–LiCl salt and electrochemically reduced to the metal form. Various approaches based on thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies have been used to understand the electrode reaction and efficiently treat spent fuels. The factors that affect the speed of the electrochemical reduction have been determined to optimize the process and scale-up the electrolysis cell. In addition, demonstrations of the integrated series of processes (electrorefining and salt distillation) with the electrochemical reduction have been conducted to realize the oxide fuel cycle. This overview provides insight into the current status of and issues related to the electrochemical processing of spent nuclear fuels.}

Facile synthesis of single-crystal 2D layered transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) is of crucial importance for the development of forthcoming technologies, such as superconducting, electromagnetic interference shielding, and energy-related applications. However, the fabrication of TMNs with natural 2D layered structure is thermodynamically difficult, in which stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employed alkali molten salts as catalysts to achieve facile and large-scale (over decagram) synthesis of a family of 2D layered TMNs, such as MoN1.2, WN1.5, and Mo0.7W0.3N1.2, under atmospheric pressure. Ex-situ experiments reveal that the molten salt can lower the formation energy of 2D layered TMNs by assuring a liquid-gas synthesis and forming a TMN-salt-TMN superstructure as an intermediate. The resultant 2D layered TMNs show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the immense potential of 2D layered TMNs for energy-related applications and beyond.}

The catalysts and carbon products were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS, XRF and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The results show that molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity and long-term stability up to 1000 min time on stream without any deactivation. The carbon products over the molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are in the form of small granular particles instead of filamentous carbon for the catalyst without molten salt. The promotional effect of the molten salt may attribute to the higher wettability of the Fe–Ni alloy by molten salt, which can prevent the catalysts from deactivation due to carbon encapsulation.}

Despite the environmental destructive operations to produce rare earth elements, limited life cycle assessment investigations have yet been carried out. This is specifically true regarding the reduction of rare earth compounds to produce rare earth metals and alloys. In combination with mass/energy balance and stoichiometry, life cycle inventories of molten slat electrolysis process were developed in this study using industrial datasets gathered from different facilities in China and the Ecoinvent v3 database. The results showed that although mining, chemical treatment, and solvent extraction stages are the dominant contributors to the whole neodymium metal production process for most impact categories, molten salt electrolysis significantly impacts ecotoxicity, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and eutrophication categories. Moreover, neodymium fluoride production, electricity consumption, and molybdenum use in cathodes are the dominant contributors in the molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, the neodymium metal production at facilities which produce larger amounts of heavy rare earth metals/alloys demonstrates relatively lower impacts on all impact categories compared to the production of neodymium metal at refining facilities which produce light rare earth metals/alloys.}

The NaCl-PuCl3 was synthesized for this study and contained 63.4 mol% NaCl, 36.3 mol% PuCl3 and was 99.7% pure. Upon heating, the NaCl–PuCl3 eutectic was stable at temperatures up to 800°C. The onset of melting occurred at 451 ± 3°C, and the enthalpy of fusion was determined to be 23.0 ± 1.4 kJ/mol. Heat capacity measurements in the liquid phase ranged from 107.7 to 91.3 J/mol.K, with an average value of 104.6 ± 11.4 J/mol.K between 500 to 650°C. Three independent trials of the molten NaCl-PuCl3 salt found the density to be ρ(T) = 3.8589 – 9.5342·10-4 T(°C).

abstract = {We report a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT)+U study of the energetics of charged and neutral oxygen defects in both PuO2 and α-Pu2O3, and present a quantitative determination of the equilibrium compositions of reduced PuO2 (PuO2−x) as functions of environmental temperature and partial pressure of oxygen, which shows fairly agreement with corresponding high-temperature experiments. Under ambient conditions, the endothermic reduction of PuO2 to α-Pu2O3 is found to be facilitated by accompanying volume expansion of PuO2−x and the possible migration of O-vacancy, whereas further reduction of α-Pu2O3 is predicted to be much more difficult. In contrast to the endothermic oxidation of PuO2, the oxidation of α-Pu2O3 is a stable exothermic process.}

abstract = {Actinide molten salts are the basis of the liquid fuels used in molten salt reactors. Due to the inherent difficulties associated with high temperature and hazardous conditions, experimental investigations of fundamental properties of these materials are usually challenging. In this work, we describe the structure and transport of NaCl-PuCl3 mixtures using computational techniques. Three compositions were considered (16, 25, and 36 mol% PuCl3) over a temperature range (730 – 1257 K) using ab initio molecular dynamics, which provided the necessary data sets for training machine learned interatomic potentials. Molecular dynamics simulations based on these potentials were then used to determine structure and transport properties. A substantial change was noted in the structure factor when increasing the PuCl3 content from 25 to 36 mol%. This change is linked to the aggregation of larger Pu3+ clusters. In addition, the similarity of the atomic environments of metal cations in molten salt systems to their solid states counterparts was investigated using an unsupervised learning technique. Finally, graph theory was employed to explore the structure and size of actinide networks. Consistent with the structure factor, a dense Pu3+ intermolecular structure is observed within the 36 mol% PuCl3 mixture. The structure of cation-cation inter-junctions is also discussed. In all cases, the diffusion of Pu3+ is significantly lower than that of Na+ and Cl−.}
