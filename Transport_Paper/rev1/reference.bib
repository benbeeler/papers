abstract = {Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to calculate select thermophysical and thermodynamic properties of NaCl, UCl3 and NaCl-UCl3 molten salts. Following established approaches, the AIMD simulations include a model for Van der Waals interactions. The Langreth & Lundqvist (vDW-DF2), DFT-D3, and density-dependent energy correction (DFT-dDsC) dispersion models are first tested for molten NaCl in order to assess their accuracy for density and heat capacity predictions across a range of temperatures. Based on the NaCl results, the vdW-DF2 and DFT-dDsC methods are extended to the UCl3 system and compared to available experimental data. Next, mixtures of NaCl-UCl3 are investigated and analyzed with respect to the deviation from ideal solution behavior. For the DFT-dDsC simulations, density deviates by up to 2\% from an ideal mixture, with the maximum occurring close to the eutectic composition. The mixing energy also deviates from an ideal solution and exhibits a minimum of about -0.074 to eV per formula unit, again close to the eutectic composition. Finally, the compressibility and species diffusivity of the pure and mixed salt systems are calculated. The diffusivities are slightly reduced in the mixed compared to the pure systems and the compressibilities loosely follow a linear correlation as a function of the UCl3 composition. The trends observed for mixing properties are rationalized by correlating them to the coordination chemistry, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining the extended network formed by U and Cl ions as the NaCl concentration increases. The concentration at which breakdown of the extended network occurs, roughly coincides with the minimum of both the mixing energy and the deviation from ideal solution behavior for density.}

In a gas, momentum transfer occurs due to collisions between the molecules, while forces between the closely packed molecules cause the momentum transfer in liquids. Because of the complexities involved in the liquid momentum transfer mechanisms - including those due to dispersive and electrostatic forces - there has been no simple basis for the estimation of liquid viscosities. The simplicity of approach adopted in the kinetic theory applied to gas viscosity, which is of natural interest to the development of the theories on liquid viscosity will be dealt first in our discussion. This will be followed by the theories on the viscosities of dense gases and liquids.",

Special thermodynamic cycle is designed by using Ag+|AgCl(s)|Ag(s) as reference electrode and by enclosing the reduced metallic atoms in the molten salts, and thus the energies related to the chloride anions, as well as the absolute energies related metallic atoms or cations, are cancelled. In addition, self-diffusion coefficients of the cations, as well as ionic conductivities and viscosities of the molten salt mixtures are evaluated from FPMD.

abstract = {NaCl–CaCl2–MgCl2 ternary molten salt is a potential material for thermal transfer and storage applications at high temperatures. In the present work, its microstructures and thermophysical properties over a wide operating temperature range were investigated by using ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. An approach-to-equilibrium molecular dynamics method was used to calculate the thermal conductivity of molten salts. The local coordination structures and mechanisms of their temperature dependence were investigated. It can be found that the dominant bonding interactions are between cation-chlorine ion pairs, which can be considered as bridges connecting the local structures in liquids. The interaction between ions decreases with the increase of temperature as distances of ion clusters get larger. The thermophysical properties were evaluated in detail from 703 to 1173 K, showing a good accordance with the experimental data. A detailed relationship between operating temperature, microstructure, and thermophysical properties has been studied. The results suggest that the changes in thermodynamic properties with increasing temperature are caused by the variations of microstructures, in terms of the distances and bonding characteristics of ions.}

The principle, main components and design parameters of the system were presented, and thermal-hydraulic behaviors, such as natural circulation and heat removal ability, were numerically analyzed in the code of C++, especially for the bayonet cooling thimbles. The results show that the system can effectively remove decay heat in the molten salt in an MSRE and has a heat removal rate that approximates to the decay heat generation rate, thus causing the temperature of the molten salt to decrease steadily. The width of the gas gap in the bayonet cooling thimbles has little effect on either the heat exchange or the natural circulation inside the thimbles, while the width of the steam riser, in spite of its slight effect on the heat transfer of the system, greatly influences the natural circulation. With the width of the steam riser increase from 3.6 to 5.1 mm, the mass flow rate increases from 1.9 kg/s to 4.79 kg/s. Finally, three operational schemes were proposed for the passive residual heat removal system, among which that of reducing the bayonet cooling thimbles by three-quarters had the best comprehensive performance.}

Despite the environmental destructive operations to produce rare earth elements, limited life cycle assessment investigations have yet been carried out. This is specifically true regarding the reduction of rare earth compounds to produce rare earth metals and alloys. In combination with mass/energy balance and stoichiometry, life cycle inventories of molten slat electrolysis process were developed in this study using industrial datasets gathered from different facilities in China and the Ecoinvent v3 database. The results showed that although mining, chemical treatment, and solvent extraction stages are the dominant contributors to the whole neodymium metal production process for most impact categories, molten salt electrolysis significantly impacts ecotoxicity, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and eutrophication categories. Moreover, neodymium fluoride production, electricity consumption, and molybdenum use in cathodes are the dominant contributors in the molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, the neodymium metal production at facilities which produce larger amounts of heavy rare earth metals/alloys demonstrates relatively lower impacts on all impact categories compared to the production of neodymium metal at refining facilities which produce light rare earth metals/alloys.}

Facile synthesis of single-crystal 2D layered transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) is of crucial importance for the development of forthcoming technologies, such as superconducting, electromagnetic interference shielding, and energy-related applications. However, the fabrication of TMNs with natural 2D layered structure is thermodynamically difficult, in which stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employed alkali molten salts as catalysts to achieve facile and large-scale (over decagram) synthesis of a family of 2D layered TMNs, such as MoN1.2, WN1.5, and Mo0.7W0.3N1.2, under atmospheric pressure. Ex-situ experiments reveal that the molten salt can lower the formation energy of 2D layered TMNs by assuring a liquid-gas synthesis and forming a TMN-salt-TMN superstructure as an intermediate. The resultant 2D layered TMNs show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the immense potential of 2D layered TMNs for energy-related applications and beyond.}

The catalysts and carbon products were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS, XRF and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The results show that molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity and long-term stability up to 1000 min time on stream without any deactivation. The carbon products over the molten salt-promoted Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are in the form of small granular particles instead of filamentous carbon for the catalyst without molten salt. The promotional effect of the molten salt may attribute to the higher wettability of the Fe–Ni alloy by molten salt, which can prevent the catalysts from deactivation due to carbon encapsulation.}

Various approaches based on thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies have been used to understand the electrode reaction and efficiently treat spent fuels. The factors that affect the speed of the electrochemical reduction have been determined to optimize the process and scale-up the electrolysis cell. In addition, demonstrations of the integrated series of processes (electrorefining and salt distillation) with the electrochemical reduction have been conducted to realize the oxide fuel cycle.

The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

Sub-binary systems of LiCl-KCl, LiCl-PuCl3, and KCl-PuCl3 were developed first by optimizing the Gibbs energy parameters according to the experimental data from literature using the two-sublattice model. Then the enthalpy of mixing of the LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 system was estimated, to explore the ternary interactions, using an empirical correlation derived from the surrounded-ion model for the asymmetric salt system due to the scarcity of available data for the ternary system. Based on the phase diagram developed, the solubility of PuCl3 in the eutectic LiCl-KCl melt at different temperatures was obtained, as well as the Gibbs energy of formation of PuCl3 in the salt as a function of PuCl3 concentration. The present study extends the experimental data for dilutions to concentrated solutions for which no experimental data have been well reported.},

Special thermodynamic cycle is designed by using Ag+|AgCl(s)|Ag(s) as reference electrode and by enclosing the reduced metallic atoms in the molten salts, and thus the energies related to the chloride anions, as well as the absolute energies related metallic atoms or cations, are cancelled. In addition, self-diffusion coefficients of the cations, as well as ionic conductivities and viscosities of the molten salt mixtures are evaluated from FPMD. The significance and prospects of this approach and FPMD in the prediction of physicochemical properties of molten salt mixtures for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuels are discussed.},

In this work, first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) was used to model the solute behavior in eutectic LiCl–KCl and FLiBe (Li2BeF4) melts at 773 K and 973 K, respectively. The thermo-kinetic properties for solute systems such as the redox potential, solute diffusion coefficients and structural information surrounding the solute were predicted from FPMD modeling and the calculated properties are generally in agreement with the experiments. In particular, we formulate an approach to model redox energetics vs. chlorine (or fluorine) potential from first-principles approaches. This study develops approaches for, and demonstrates the capabilities of, FPMD to model solute properties in molten salts.}

abstract = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {The structural evolution of MgCl2-based materials is of considerable interest due to their current and potential applications in numerous technologies, such as electrolyte in magnesium electrolysis, secondary coolant for high-temperature reactors, and a new generation heat transfer fluid for concentrated solar power systems. However, their intrinsic feature is poorly understood and difficult to obtain with experimental techniques. In this work, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations (FPMD) are adopted to investigate the structural evolution of molten MgCl2-KCl fused salt. Examination of the radial distribution function, probability distribution of coordination numbers and bond angle distribution of the melts reveals that the local geometry of the Mg converts from mainly tetrahedral to a distorted octahedral with one-two anion vacancies as the concentration of MgCl2 is increased. Accompanied by this structural change, there are also corresponding variations in the stability and dynamics of the system. Further analysis of the stability and the lifetime of the MgCl bond indicate that the coordinated Cl− anions around Mg2+ cations are more dynamic in MgCl2 richer compositions. Moreover, this study shows that the addition of MgCl2 will inhibited the formation of isolated structural units and promote the extension of Mg chains. In conclusion, the simulations successfully reproduce the structural features of MgCl2-KCl melts and highlight the application prospects of FPMD simulations in revealing the local structure of molten salts.}
