Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential.},

Results from postirradiation examinations of the AFC-3A and AFC-3B are presented here. In this irradiation, U alloyed with Mo, Zr, and Zr with Pd were investigated. Different geometric forms (solid, annular), smear densities and bonding media (sodium, helium) were also irradiated and evaluated. All fuel forms were irradiated in ferritic-martensitic HT-9 cladding. Examination of the irradiated fuel included neutron radiography, evaluation of the distribution of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides, dimensional inspection, fission gas release analysis, optical microscopy, and chemical analysis. No in-pile failure was observed with this fuel. Neutron radiography, gamma spectrometry, and dimensional inspections indicated the fuel largely performed acceptably. Optical microscopy revealed significant fuel-cladding interaction between the Mo based alloys and the cladding. The Zr based alloys generally performed better although some forms revealed behaviors that present specific fabrication challenges such as tighter fabrication tolerances that will need to be better controlled to match historical U-Zr fuel performance. The addition of Pd as an additive to prevent fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) also appears to present some challenges to fuel performance.},

It is clear that the richness of physical phenomena for these compounds is a result of partially filled 3

              and
              f
              electrons with each other and with itinerant electronic states of the material are responsible for its anomalous properties. Electronic structure calculations for strongly correlated materials should explicitly take into account Coulombic interactions between

              or
              f
              electrons. Recent advances in this field are related to the development of the LDA+DMFT method, which combines local density approximation (LDA) with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to account for electronic correlation effects. In recent years, LDA+DMFT has allowed the successful treatment not only of simple systems but also of complicated real compounds. Nowadays, the LDA+DMFT method is the state-of-the-art tool for investigating correlated metals and insulators, spin and metal–insulator transitions (MIT) in transition-metal compounds in paramagnetic and magnetically ordered phases.},

The model-predicted enthalpies of formation for the bcc and d phases are in good agreement with the results from DFT + U ab initio calculations. The calculations in this work show better agreements with experimental data comparing with the previous assessments. Using the integrated method of ab initio and CALPHAD modeling, an unexpected relation between the enthalpy of formation of the d phase and energy of Zr with hexagonal structure is revealed and the model improved by ﬁtting these energies together.

	abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) approach to computing transition metal oxide heat of formation without adjustable parameters is presented. Different degrees of d-electron localization in oxides are treated within the DFT+U approach with site-dependent, first-principles Hubbard U-parameters obtained from linear response theory, and delocalized states in the metallic phases are treated without Hubbard corrections. Comparison of relative stabilities of these differently treated phases is enabled by a local d-electron density matrix-dependent model, which was found by genetic programming against experimental reference formation enthalpies. This mathematically simple model does not explicitly depend on the Hubbard-corrected ionic species and is shown to reproduce the heats of formation of the Mott insulators Ca2RuO4 and Y2Ru2O7 within ∼3\% of experimental results, where the experimental training data did not contain Ru oxides. This newly developed method thus absolves from the need for element-specific corrections fitted to experiments in existing Hubbard-corrected approaches to the prediction of reaction energies of transition metal oxides and metals. The absence of fitting parameters opens up here the possibility to predict relative thermodynamic stabilities and reaction energies involving d-states of varying degree of localization at transition metal oxide interfaces and defects, where site-dependent U-parameters will be particularly important and devising a fitting scheme against experimental data with predictive power would be exceedingly difficult.},

The weak temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the small value of both Seebeck (0.75 μV/K at room temperature) and of the Sommerfeld coefficient (13.5 mJ mol–1 K–2) point to 5f-electrons in this material having a delocalised nature. The electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance indicate the presence of significant electronic disorder in δ-UZr2, consistent with the disorder in its crystal structure.

In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N3atoms operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N2atoms scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. © 1996 The American Physical Society., This article appears in the following collection:},

We here consider hydrogen insertion in UZr2 intermetallic leading to experimentally observed composition UZr2H6. Drastic changes are shown from density functional calculations to induce atom reordering within the metal substructures in the ground state. Particularly among different starting hypotheses for H sites, energy minimization is observed when the hydrogenated intermetallic undergoes metal substructures reordering with unmixed occupancy of Al (U) and B (Zr) sites in AlB2 type structure. Hydrogen is identified as covalently bonded within the plane of Zr metal, illustrated by anionic charged H−0.55 derived from Bader analysis of charge density. Hydrogen uptake leads to prevailing volume expansion effects versus chemical bonding ones, involving strong localization of uranium 5f states and increased magnetization versus the pristine intermetallic. Both the intermetallic and the ternary hydride are found ferromagnetic in the ground state.},

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {The Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) was a 62.5 MWt–20 MWe sodium cooled fast reactor that was operated successfully for 30 years. Over its period of operation a wealth of fuels and materials information originated from EBR-II. Several missions were conducted in EBR-II, all of which yielded new and valuable additions to the world's knowledge base for nuclear materials. Some of the first pioneering experiments on irradiation effects in stainless steels were conducted in EBR-II. Later, practical manifestations of enhanced irradiation creep, swelling, and loss of ductility were experienced on EBR-II components. In addition, for a period of more than 15 years, the EBR-II reactor would become the primary irradiation facility for all fast reactor fuels and materials research and development. Both the initial mission and final mission for EBR-II (the Integral Fast Reactor Concept, IFR), involved the remote reprocessing and irradiation of fast reactor metallic fuels. The fuels and materials information gleaned from these missions will be summarized with the intent of portraying a sample of the valuable legacy that EBR-II contributed to the world's store of nuclear fuels and materials knowledge.},

The alloys were characterized by SEM micrograph. The phase analysis was performed with the help of XRD and the phase transformation temperatures were determined by DTA. The variation in crystal structure with subsequent replacement of Zr with Nb as an alloying element has been highlighted.

Differential formation and growth of irradiation-induced voids and bubbles were observed from as-cast uranium-zirconium (U–Zr) alloys including 0.1 and 40 wt\% zirconium. The U–Zr alloys were irradiated with 140-keV He+ ions with fluences ranged from 1 × 1014 ions/cm2 to 5 × 1016 ions/cm2. Several larger spherical bubbles ({\textless}∼70 nm) were revealed from an irradiated single α-U phase alloy (U–0.1Zr) in which observed bubbles were mobile under 200-keV electron beam of transmission electron microscope (TEM). In-situ mergence and leakage of the bubbles in the uranium-rich alloy was also evident during the observation. In contrast, numerous number of small (∼6 nm) angular voids, or low pressure bubbles, were found in an irradiated δ-UZr2 phase alloy (U–40Zr), in which the radiation-induced nanostructure was stationary throughout the observation. This study may reaffirm higher radiation-susceptibility of the α-U phase than the δ-UZr2 phase, which could strengthen the needs of separate accounting of solid phase effects for metallic fuel performance modeling particularly regarding the fuel restructuring phenomena, such as fission gas swelling and constituent redistribution, since conventional models are commonly adopted homogeneous medium assumption, not in accordance with the results of post-irradiation examinations of used metallic nuclear fuel in which the formation of several concentric phase zone was distinct corresponding to a steep radial temperature gradient in the fuel pin and multiple isotherm lines in the binary phase diagram of U–Zr alloy system.},

One such application involves U–Zr as nuclear fuel, where radiation damage and diffusion (processes heavily dependent on point defects) are of vital importance. Several systems of U are examined within a density functional theory framework utilizing projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. Two separate generalized gradient approximations of the exchange-correlation are used to calculate defect properties and are compared. The bulk modulus, the lattice constant, and the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state for the defect free bcc uranium allotrope are calculated. Defect parameters calculated include energies of formation of vacancies in the α and γ allotropes, as well as self-interstitials, Zr interstitials, and Zr substitutional defects for the γ allotrope. The results for vacancies agree very well with experimental and previous computational studies. The most probable self-interstitial site in γ-U is the ⟨110⟩ dumbbell, and the most probable defect location for dilute Zr in γ-U is the substitutional site. This is the first detailed study of self-defects in the bcc allotrope of U and also the first comprehensive study of dilute Zr defects in γ-U.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) is often alloyed with molybdenum (Mo) or zirconium (Zr) in order to stabilize its high-temperature body-centered cubic phase for use in nuclear reactors. However, in all metallic fuel forms, the α phase of U remains in some fraction. This phase decomposition due to temperature or compositional variance can play an outsized role on fuel performance and microstructural evolution. Relatively little is known about fundamental point defect properties in α-U at non-zero temperatures, from either computational or experimental studies. This work performs the first thorough evaluation of the α phase of U via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). A number of thermophysical properties are calculated as a function of temperature, including equilibrium lattice parameters, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. These results indicate a two-region behavior, with the transition at 400 K. The thermal expansion/contraction in the a/b direction occurs rapidly from 100 up to 400 K, after which a more linear and gradual change in the lattice constant takes place. The volumetric expansion matches experiments quantitatively, but the individual lattice constant expansion only matches experiments qualitatively. Point defect formation energies and induced lattice strains are also determined as a function of temperature, providing insight on defect populations and the fundamentals of irradiation growth in α-U. Interstitials induce significantly more strain than vacancies, and the nature of that strain is highly dependent on the individual lattice directions. The direction of point defect-induced lattice strain is contrary to the irradiation growth behavior of α-U. This work shows that isolated point defects cannot be the primary driving force responsible for the significant irradiation-induced growth of α-U observed experimentally.},

	abstract = {Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising nuclear fuel that combines the advantageous properties of readily used UO2 and uranium alloys, such as high melting temperature and high uranium density, and thermal conductivity, respectively. A better understanding of UN behavior at operating temperatures can be obtained from finite temperature data, such as elastic properties. To get this information, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed at five different temperatures using constant volume (NVT) and constant pressure (NPT) ensembles. Initially, the performance of PBE functional in reproducing experimental crystallographic properties and magnetic ordering is assessed. The finite temperature phonon dispersions are calculated using NVT simulation results, which show a softening of the phonon modes with increasing temperature. The NPT results are used to obtain the thermal expansion of UN and finite temperature electronic properties. The calculated thermal expansion is compared with our measurements using neutron diffraction. Additionally, the temperature dependent elastic properties of UN are evaluated using the strain-stress method in AIMD simulations, indicating that UN becomes softer and more compressible with increasing temperature. Also, the calculated Young’s modulus slope is in very good agreement with the experiment. The finite temperature heat capacity and electronic thermal conductivity are calculated from AIMD simulations, which are in better agreement with the experiment than the heat capacity and thermal conductivity calculated using the structures relaxed at 0 K. Lastly, the thermal diffusivity from AIMD has opposite temperature dependence compared to experimental results, which we argued comes from the underestimated electronic thermal conductivity.},

Also, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) was argued to advance the aforementioned properties in these systems. We demonstrate, contrarily, that neither the Hubbard U approach nor SOC is necessary for a correct description of uranium metal and U-Zr alloys. We further illustrate that the combination of DFT+U and SOC in the projector augmented-wave calculations by Xie et al. results in unrealistically large volume expansions, particularly for γ-U, in stark contrast to all previous calculations for elemental uranium. This in turn may also explain why the DFT+U with SOC model predicts negative enthalpy of mixing in the U-Zr alloy system contradicting conventional DFT as well as one of the main features of the experimental U-Zr phase diagram. The assertion by Xie et al. that DFT+U is an improvement over DFT for these systems is illustrated to be incorrect.},

The c11, c33, and c44 differ considerably among the three metals, whereas the c66 shear moduli for Ti and Zr are similar to within 1\% between 4 and 300°K and less than 10\% at 1100°K. There is very marked anisotropy in the temperature dependence of the shear moduli in Ti and Zr, c66 decreasing by 75\% between 4 and 1100°K whereas c44 decreases by 40\%. A very pronounced deviation from a linear temperature dependence of c66 occurs at a temperature which coincides with the anomalous curvatures in the published electrical resistivity data. The relatively small c66 shear moduli at the hcp → bcc phase transformation temperatures are as expected from the transformation shear mechanisms suggested by Burger. A survey of existing elastic modulus and thermal expansion data in hcp metals leads to the conclusion that a relatively high temperature dependence in c66 and the occurrence of hcp → bcc transformations are characteristic of metals with ca{\textless}1.60. It is suggested that these characteristics due to the transverse thermal vibrations in the basal planes, and that the transformation results from anharmonic contributions to the free energy which are indicated by specific heat data. Contrary to comparison in other hcp metals, the Debye θ from 4°K elastic moduli in Ti, Zr, and Hf are in excellent agreement with published specific heat data. A slight anomaly at 18°K in Ti is indicated which may be associated with published resistivity minima in Ti alloys.},

	abstract = {Although the formalism that allows the calculation of alloy thermodynamic properties from first-principles has been known for decades, its practical implementation has so far remained a tedious process. The Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) drastically simplifies this procedure by implementing decision rules based on formal statistical analysis that frees the researchers from a constant monitoring during the calculation process and automatically "glues" together the input and the output of various codes, in order to provide a high-level interface to the calculation of alloy thermodynamic properties from first-principles. ATAT implements the Structure Inversion Method (SIM), also known as the Connolly-Williams method, in combination with semi-grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations. In order to make this powerful toolkit available to the wide community of researchers who could benefit from it, this article present a concise user guide outlining the steps required to obtain thermodynamic information from ab initio calculations.},

ATAT can now handle multicomponent multisublattice alloy systems, nonconfigurational sources of entropy (e.g. vibrational and electronic entropy), Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) generation, tensorial cluster expansion construction and includes interfaces for multiple atomistic or ab initio codes. This paper presents an overview of these features geared towards the practical use of the code. The extensions to the cluster expansion formalism needed to cover multicomponent multisublattice alloys are also formally demonstrated.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm to generate Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS), i.e., best periodic supercell approximations to the true disordered state for a given number of atoms per supercell. The method is based on a Monte Carlo simulated annealing loop with an objective function that seeks to perfectly match the maximum number of correlation functions (as opposed to merely minimizing the distance between the SQS correlation and the disordered state correlations for a pre-specified set of correlations). The proposed method optimizes the shape of the supercell jointly with the occupation of the atomic sites, thus ensuring that the configurational space searched is exhaustive and not biased by a pre-specified supercell shape. The method has been implemented in the “mcsqs” code of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) in the most general framework of multicomponent multisublattice systems and in a way that minimizes the amount of input information the user needs to specify and that allows for efficient parallelization.},

	abstract = {This work characterizes the crystallographic evolution of unirradiated U-X wt.\% Zr (X = 6, 10, 20, 30) while cooling from equilibration, single phase γ-U-Zr, at 900 °C to ambient temperature using time-of-flight neutron diffraction. The β-U phase was unobserved during cooling at 1 °C/min in all alloys. All alloys followed the phase transformation pathway of γ-U-Zr→γ-U-Zr+α-U→α-U +δ-UZr2 with an observed miscibility gap in γ-U-Zr. The α-U and δ-UZr2 transformation took place simultaneously in the U-30 wt.\% Zr sample. These findings strengthen the need to re-approach the U-Zr phase diagram in entirety. Bulk volumetric CTEs agree well with published data, strengthening the quantification of lattice-specific CTEs reported in this study. A compositionally dependent discontinuity in thermal expansion, increasing in magnitude with decreasing U content, occurs during the γ-U-Zr→α-U+δ-UZr2 transformation. The γ-U-Zr lattice parameter was measured to have a compositional dependency.},
